<h2><small>CHAPTER I</small><br />

<span class="smcap">AT &ldquo;MacGONIGAL&rsquo;S&rdquo;</span></h2>


<p>&ldquo;Hullo, Mac!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hullo, Derry!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s got the boys today? Is there a
round-up somewhere?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Looks that-a way,&rdquo; said Mac, grabbing a soiled
cloth with an air of decision, and giving the pine
counter a vigorous rub. At best, he was a man of
few words, and the few were generally to the point;
yet his questioner did not seem to notice the noncommittal
nature of the reply, and, after an amused
glance at the industrious Mac, quitted the store as
swiftly as he had entered it. But he flung an explanatory
word over his shoulder:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Guess I&rsquo;ll see to that plug myself&mdash;he&rsquo;s fallen
lame.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then John Darien Power swung out again into the
vivid sunshine of Colorado (&ldquo;vivid&rdquo; is the correct
adjective for sunshine thereabouts in June about the
hour of the siesta) and gently encouraged a dispirited
mustang to hobble on three legs into the iron-roofed
lean-to which served as a stable at &ldquo;MacGonigal&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
Meanwhile, the proprietor of the store
gazed after Power&rsquo;s retreating figure until neither man
nor horse was visible. Even then, in an absent-minded
way, he continued to survey as much of the dusty sur<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>face
of the Silver State as was revealed through the
rectangle of the doorway, a vista slightly diminished
by the roof of a veranda. What he saw in the foreground
was a whitish brown plain, apparently a desert,
but in reality a plateau, or &ldquo;park,&rdquo; as the local
name has it, a tableland usually carpeted not only
with grama and buffalo grasses curing on the stem, but
also with flowers in prodigal abundance and of bewildering
varieties. True, in the picture framed by the
open door neither grass-stems nor flowers were visible,
unless to the imaginative eye. There was far too much
coming and going of men and animals across the strip
of common which served the purposes of a main street
in Bison to permit the presence of active vegetation
save during the miraculous fortnight after the spring
rains, when, by local repute, green whiskers will grow
on a bronze dog. Scattered about the immediate vicinity
were the ramshackle houses of men employed in
the neighboring gold and silver reduction works. The
makeshift for a roadway which pierced this irregular
settlement led straight to MacGonigal&rsquo;s, and ended
there. As every man, woman, and child in the place
came to the store at some time of the day or night,
and invariably applied Euclid&rsquo;s definition of the nearest
way between two given points, the flora of Colorado
was quickly stamped out of recognition in that
particular locality, except during the irrepressible
period when, as already mentioned, the fierce rains of
April pounded the sleeping earth and even bronze dogs
into a frenzied activity. Further, during that year,
now nearly quarter of a century old, there had been
no rain in April or May, and precious little in March.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
As the ranchers put it, in the figurative language of
their calling, &ldquo;the hull blame state was burnt to a
cinder.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The middle distance was lost altogether; for the
park sloped, after the manner of plateaus, to a deep
valley through which trickled a railroad and the remains
of a river. Some twenty miles away a belt of
woodland showed where Denver was justifying its name
by growing into a city, and forty miles beyond Denver
rose the blue ring of the Rocky Mountains. These
details, be it understood, are given with the meticulous
accuracy insisted on by map-makers. In a country
where, every year, the percentage of &ldquo;perfectly clear&rdquo;
days rises well above the total of all other sorts of
days, and where a popular and never-failing joke
played on the newcomer is to persuade him into taking
an afternoon stroll from Denver to Mount Evans, a
ramble of over sixty miles as the crow flies, the mind
refuses to be governed by theodolites and measuring
rods. Indeed, the deceptive clarity of the air leads
to exaggeration at the other end of the scale, because
no true son or daughter of Colorado will walk a hundred
yards if there is a horse or car available for the
journey. Obviously, walking is a vain thing when the
horizon and the next block look equidistant.</p>

<p>It may, however, be taken for granted that none
of these considerations accounted for MacGonigal&rsquo;s
fixed stare at the sunlit expanse. In fact, it is probable
that his bulging eyes took in no special feature
of the landscape; for they held an introspective look,
and he stopped polishing the counter as abruptly as
he had begun that much-needed operation when Power<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
entered the store. He indulged in soliloquy, too,
as the habit is of some men in perplexity. Shifting
the cigar he was smoking from the left corner of
his wide mouth to the right one by a dexterous twisting
of lips, with tongue and teeth assisting, he said aloud:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, ef I ain&rsquo;t dog-goned!&rdquo;</p>

<p>So, whatever it was, the matter was serious. It
was a convention at Bison that all conversation should
be suspended among the frequenters of MacGonigal&rsquo;s
when the storekeeper remarked that he was dog-goned.
Ears already alert were tuned at once to intensity.
When Mac was dog-goned, events of vital importance
to the community had either happened or were about
to happen. Why, those words, uttered by him, common
as they were in the mouths of others, had been known
to stop One-thumb Jake from opening a jack-pot on
a pat straight! Of course, the pot was opened all
right after the social avanlanche heralded by the storekeeper&rsquo;s
epoch-making ejaculation had rolled past, or
Jake&rsquo;s remaining thumb might have been shot off during
the subsequent row.</p>

<p>Apparently, MacGonigal was thinking hard, listening,
too; for he seemed to be following Power&rsquo;s movements,
and nodded his head in recognition of the rattle
of a chain as the horse was tied to a feeding trough,
the clatter of a zinc bucket when Power drew water
from a tank, and the stamping of hoofs while Power
was persuading the lame mustang to let him bathe
and bandage the injured tendons. Then the animal
was given a drink&mdash;he would be fed later&mdash;and the
ring of spurred boots on the sun-baked ground announced
that Derry was returning to the store.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>

<p>Power&rsquo;s nickname, in a land where a man&rsquo;s baptismal
certificate is generally ignored, was easily accounted
for by his second name, Darien, conferred by a proud
mother in memory of a journey across the Isthmus
when, as a girl, she was taken from New York to
San Francisco by the oldtime sea route. The other
day, when he stood for a minute or so in the foyer of
the Savoy Hotel in London, waiting while his automobile
was summoned from the courtyard, he seemed to
have lost little of the erect, sinewy figure and lithe
carriage which were his most striking physical characteristics
twenty-five years ago; but the smooth, dark-brown
hair had become gray, and was slightly frizzled
about the temples, and the clean-cut oval of his face
bore records of other tempests than those noted by
the Weather Bureau. In walking, too, he moved with
a decided limp. At fifty, John Darien Power looked
the last man breathing whom a storekeeper in a disheveled
mining village would hail as &ldquo;Derry&rdquo;; yet it
may be safely assumed that his somewhat hard and
care-lined lips would have softened into a pleasant smile
had someone greeted him in the familiar Colorado way.
And, when that happened, the friend of bygone years
would be sure that no mistake had been made as to his
identity; for, in those early days, Power always won
approval when he smiled. His habitual expression was
one of concentrated purpose, and his features were
cast in a mold that suggested repose and strength.
Indeed, their classic regularity of outline almost bespoke
a harsh nature were it not for the lurking humor
in his large brown eyes, which were shaded by lashes
so long, and black, and curved that most women who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
met him envied him their possession. Children and
dogs adopted him as a friend promptly and without
reservation; but strangers of adult age were apt to
regard him as a rather morose and aloof-mannered person,
distinctly frigid and self-possessed, until some
chance turn in the talk brought laughter to eyes and
lips. Then a carefully veiled kindliness of heart seemed
to bubble to the surface and irradiate his face. All
the severity of firm mouth and determined chin disappeared
as though by magic; and one understood the
force of the simile used by a western schoolma&rsquo;am,
who contributed verse to the <i>Rocky Mountain News</i>,
when she said that Derry&rsquo;s smile reminded her of a
sudden burst of sunshine which had converted into a
sparkling mirror the somber gloom of a lake sunk in
the depths of some secluded valley. Even in Colorado,
people of the poetic temperament write in that
strain.</p>

<p>Now, perhaps, you have some notion of the sort
of young man it was who came back to the dog-goned
MacGonigal on that June day in the half-forgotten
&rsquo;80&rsquo;s. Add to the foregoing description certain intimate
labels&mdash;that he was a mining engineer, that he
had been educated in the best schools of the Far West,
that he was slender, and well knit, and slightly above
the middle height, and that he moved with the gait
of a horseman and an athlete&mdash;and the portrait is fairly
complete.</p>

<p>The storekeeper was Power&rsquo;s physical antithesis.
He was short and fat, and never either walked or rode;
but his North of Ireland ancestors had bequeathed him
a shrewd brain and a Scottish slowness of speech that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
gave him time to review his thoughts before they were
uttered. No sooner did he hear his visitor&rsquo;s approaching
footsteps than he began again to polish the pine
boards which barricaded him from the small world of
Bison.</p>

<p>Such misplaced industry won a smile from the
younger man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gee whizz, Mac, it makes me hot to see you work!&rdquo;
he cried. &ldquo;Anyhow, if you&rsquo;ve been whirling that duster
ever since I blew in you must be tired, so you can
quit now, and fix me a bimetallic.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With a curious alacrity, the stout MacGonigal threw
the duster aside, and reached for a bottle of whisky,
an egg, a siphon of soda, and some powdered sugar.
Colorado is full of local color, even to the naming of
its drinks. In a bimetallic the whole egg is used,
and variants of the concoction are a gold fizz and a
silver fizz, wherein the yoke and the white figure
respectively.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whar you been, Derry?&rdquo; inquired the storekeeper,
whose massive energy was now concentrated on the
proper whisking of the egg.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you heard? Marten sent me to erect the
pump on a placer mine he bought near Sacramento.
It&rsquo;s a mighty good proposition, too, and I&rsquo;ve done
pretty well to get through in four months.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Guess I was told about the mine; but I plumb
forgot. Marten was here a bit sence, an&rsquo; he said
nothin&rsquo;.&rdquo; Power laughed cheerfully. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be surprised
to see me, and that&rsquo;s a fact. He counted on the
job using up the best part of the summer, right into
the fall; but I made those Chicago mechanics open up<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
the throttle, and here I am, having left everything in
full swing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you write?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, to Denver. I don&rsquo;t mind telling you, Mac,
that I would have been better pleased if the boss was
there now. I came slick through, meaning to make
Denver tomorrow. Where is he&mdash;at the mill?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was thar this mornin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Power was frankly puzzled by MacGonigal&rsquo;s excess
of reticence. He knew the man so well that he wondered
what sinister revelation lay behind this twice-repeated
refusal to give a direct reply to his questions.
By this time the appetizing drink was ready, and he
swallowed it with the gusto of one who had found
the sun hot and the trail dusty, though he had ridden
only three miles from the railroad station in the valley,
where he was supplied with a lame horse by the blunder
of a negro attendant at the hotel.</p>

<p>It was his way to solve a difficulty by taking the
shortest possible cut; but, being quite in the dark
as to the cause of his friend&rsquo;s perceptible shirking of
some unknown trouble, he decided to adopt what logicians
term a process of exhaustion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All well at Dolores?&rdquo; he asked, looking straight
into the storekeeper&rsquo;s prominent eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bully!&rdquo; came the unblinking answer.</p>

<p>Ah! The worry, whatsoever it might be, evidently
did not concern John Darien Power in any overwhelming
degree.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then what have you got on your chest, Mac?&rdquo;
he said, while voice and manner softened from an unmistakably
stiffening.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<p>MacGonigal seemed to regard this personal inquiry
anent his well-being as affording a safe means of escape
from a dilemma. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m scairt about you, Derry,&rdquo; he
said at once, and there was no doubting the sincerity
of the words.</p>

<p>&ldquo;About me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yep. Guess you&rsquo;d better hike back to Sacramento.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Marten &rsquo;ud like it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Man, I&rsquo;ve written to tell him I was on the way
to Denver!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then git a move on, an&rsquo; go thar.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Power smiled, though not with his wonted geniality,
for he was minded to be sarcastic. &ldquo;Sorry if I should
offend the boss by turning up in Bison,&rdquo; he drawled;
&ldquo;but if I can&rsquo;t hold this job down I&rsquo;ll monkey around
till I find another. If you should happen to see Marten
this afternoon, tell him I&rsquo;m at the ranch, and will show
up in Main Street tomorrow <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was actually turning on his heel when MacGonigal
cried:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, Derry, air you heeled?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Power swung round again, astonishment writ large
on his face. &ldquo;Why, no,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not likely to
be carrying a gold brick to Dolores. Who&rsquo;s going to
hold me up?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bar jokin&rsquo;, I wish you&rsquo;d vamoose. Dang me, come
back tomorrer, ef you must!&rdquo;</p>

<p>There! MacGonigal had said it! In a land where
swearing is a science this Scoto-Hibernico-American
had earned an enviable repute for the mildness of his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
expletives, and his &ldquo;dang me!&rdquo; was as noteworthy in
Bison as its European equivalent in the mouth of
a British archbishop. Power was immensely surprised
by his bulky friend&rsquo;s emphatic earnestness, and cudgeled
his brains to suggest a reasonable explanation.
Suddenly it occurred to him a second time that Bison
was singularly empty of inhabitants that day. MacGonigal&rsquo;s
query with regard to a weapon was also
significant, and he remembered that when he left
the district there was pending a grave dispute between
ranchers and squatters as to the inclosing of
certain grazing lands on the way to the East and its
markets.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are the boys wire-cutting today?&rdquo; he asked, in
the accents of real concern; for any such expedition
would probably bring about a struggle which might
not end till one or both of the opposing parties ran
short of ammunition.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nit,&rdquo; growled the other. &ldquo;Why argy? You jest
take my say-so, Derry, an&rsquo; skate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is the boss mixed up in this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yep.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, he can take care of himself as well as anyone
I know. So long, Mac. See you later.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, come off, Derry. You&rsquo;ve got to have it; but
don&rsquo;t say I didn&rsquo;t try to help. The crowd are up at
Dolores. Marten&rsquo;s gittin&rsquo; married, an&rsquo; that&rsquo;s all there
is to it. Now I guess you&rsquo;ll feel mad with me for
not tellin&rsquo; you sooner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Power&rsquo;s face blanched under its healthy tan of sun
and air; but his voice was markedly clear and controlled
when he spoke, which, however, he did not do<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
until some seconds after MacGonigal had made what
was, for him, quite an oration.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why should Marten go to Dolores to get married?&rdquo;
he said at last.</p>

<p>The storekeeper humped his heavy shoulders, and
conjured the cigar across his mouth again. He did
not flinch under the sudden fire which blazed in Power&rsquo;s
eyes; nevertheless, he remained silent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mac,&rdquo; went on the younger man, still uttering each
word deliberately, &ldquo;do you mean that Marten is marrying
Nancy Willard?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yep.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;ve kept me here all this time! God in
Heaven, Man, find me a horse!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too late, Derry. They was wed three hours
sence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Too late for what? Get me a horse!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s not a nag left in Bison. An&rsquo; it&rsquo;ll do
you no sort of good ter shoot Marten.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mac, you&rsquo;re no fool. He sent me to Sacramento
to have me out of the way, and you&rsquo;ve seen through
it right along.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe. But old man Willard was dead broke.
This dry spell put him slick under the harrow. Nancy
married Marten ter save her father.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a lie! They made her believe it, perhaps;
but Willard could have won through as others have
done. That scheming devil Marten got me side-tracked
on purpose. He planned it, just as David put Uriah
in the forefront of the battle. But, by God, he&rsquo;s not
a king, any more than I&rsquo;m a Hittite! Nancy Willard
is not for him, nor ever will be. Give me&mdash;but I know<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
you won&rsquo;t, and it doesn&rsquo;t matter, anyway, because I&rsquo;d
rather tear him with my hands.&rdquo;</p>

<p>An overpowering sense of wrong and outrage had
Power in its grip now, and his naturally sallow skin
had assumed an ivory whiteness that was dreadful to
see. So rigid was his self-control that he gave no other
sign of the passion that was convulsing him. Turning
toward the door, he thrust his right hand to the side
of the leather belt he wore; but withdrew it instantly,
for he was a law-abiding citizen, and had obeyed in
letter and spirit the recently enacted ordinance against
the carrying of weapons. He would have gone without
another word had not MacGonigal slipped from
behind the counter with the deft and catlike ease of
movement which some corpulent folk of both sexes seem
to possess. Running lightly and stealthily on his toes,
he caught Power&rsquo;s arm before the latter was clear of
the veranda which shaded the front of the store.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whar &rsquo;r you goin&rsquo;, Derry?&rdquo; he asked, with a note
of keen solicitude in his gruff voice that came oddly in
a man accustomed to the social amenities of a mining
camp.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Leave me alone, Mac. I must be alone!&rdquo; Then
Power bent a flaming glance on him. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve told
me the truth?&rdquo; he added in a hoarse whisper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure thing. You must ha passed the minister
between here an&rsquo; the depot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He had been there&mdash;to marry them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yep.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And everyone is up at the ranch, drinking the
health of Marten and his bride?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Guess that&rsquo;s so.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Power tried to shake off the detaining hand. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
a pity that I should be an uninvited guest, but it
can&rsquo;t be helped,&rdquo; he said savagely. &ldquo;You see, I was
carrying out the millionaire&rsquo;s orders&mdash;earning him
more millions&mdash;and I ought to have taken longer over
the job. And, Nancy too! What lie did they tell her
about me? I hadn&rsquo;t asked her to be my wife, because
it wouldn&rsquo;t have been fair; yet&mdash;but she knew! She
knew! Let me go, Mac!&rdquo;</p>

<p>MacGonigal clutched him more tightly. &ldquo;Ah, say,
Derry,&rdquo; he cried thickly, &ldquo;hev&rsquo; you forgot you&rsquo;ve left
me yer mother&rsquo;s address in San Francisco? In case
of accidents, you said. Well, am I ter write an&rsquo; tell
her you killed a man on his weddin&rsquo; day, and was hanged
for it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For the Lord&rsquo;s sake, don&rsquo;t hold me, Mac!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The storekeeper, with a wisdom born of much experience,
took his hand off Power&rsquo;s arm at once, but
contrived to edge forward until he was almost facing
his distraught friend.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, look-a here!&rdquo; he said slowly. &ldquo;This air a
mighty bad business; but you cahn&rsquo;t mend it, an&rsquo; ef
you go cavortin&rsquo; round in a red-eyed temper you&rsquo;ll sure
make it wuss. You&rsquo;ve lost the gal&mdash;never mind how&mdash;an&rsquo;
gittin&rsquo; a strangle hold on Marten won&rsquo;t bring
her back. Yer mother&rsquo;s a heap more to you ner that
gal&mdash;now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>One wonders what hidden treasury of insight into
the deeps of human nature MacGonigal was drawing
on by thus bringing before the mind&rsquo;s eye of an unhappy
son the mother he loved. But there was no
gainsaying the soundness and efficiency of his judgment.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
Only half comprehending his friendly counselor&rsquo;s purpose,
Power quivered like a high-spirited horse under
the prick of a spur. He put his hands to his face,
as if the gesture would close out forever the horrific
vision which the memory of that gray-haired woman
in San Francisco was beginning to dispel. For the first
time in his young life he had felt the lust of slaying,
and the instinct of the jungle thrilled through every
nerve, till his nails clenched and his teeth bit in a spasm
of sheer delirium.</p>

<p>MacGonigal, despite his present load of flesh, must
have passed through the fiery furnace himself in other
days; for he recognized the varying phases of the obsession
against which Power was fighting.</p>

<p>Hence, he knew when to remain silent, and, again,
he knew when to exorcise the demon, once and for all,
by the spoken word. It was so still there on that
sun-scorched plateau that the mellow whistle of an
engine came full-throated from the distant railroad.
The lame horse, bothered by the tight bandage which
Power had contrived out of a girth, pawed uneasily in
his stall. From the reduction works, half a mile away,
came the grinding clatter of a mill chewing ore in
its steel jaws. These familiar sounds served only to
emphasize the brooding solitude of the place. Some imp
of mischief seemed to whisper that every man who
could be spared from his work, and every woman and
child able to walk, was away making merry at the
wedding of Hugh Marten and Nancy Willard.</p>

<p>The storekeeper must have heard that malicious
prompting, and he combated it most valiantly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Guess you&rsquo;d better come inside, Derry,&rdquo; he said,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
with quiet sympathy. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re feelin&rsquo; mighty bad, an&rsquo;
I allow you hain&rsquo;t touched a squar&rsquo; meal sence the Lord
knows when.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He said the right thing by intuition. The mere
fantasy of the implied belief that a quantity of cold
meat and pickles, washed down by a pint of Milwaukee
lager, would serve as an emollient for raw emotion,
restored Power to his right mind. He placed a
hand on MacGonigal&rsquo;s shoulder, and the brown eyes
which met his friend&rsquo;s no longer glowered with frenzy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m all right now,&rdquo; he said, in a dull, even voice;
for this youngster of twenty-five owned an extra share
of that faculty of self-restraint which is the birthright
of every man and woman born and bred on the back-bone
of North America. &ldquo;I took it pretty hard at first,
Mac; but I&rsquo;m not one to cry over spilt milk. You
know that, eh? No, I can&rsquo;t eat or drink yet awhile.
I took a lunch below here at the depot. Tell me this,
will you? They&mdash;they&rsquo;ll be leaving by train?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yep. Special saloon kyar on the four-ten east.
I reckon you saw it on a sidin&rsquo;, but never suspicioned
why it was thar.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;East? New York and Europe, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Guess that&rsquo;s about the line.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll show up here about half-past four. Till
then I&rsquo;ll fool round by myself. Don&rsquo;t worry, Mac.
I mean that, and no more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He walked a few yards; but was arrested by a cry:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not that-a way, Derry! Any other old trail but
that!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Power laughed; but his laughter was the wail
of a soul in pain, for he had gone in the direction of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
the Dolores ranch. He waved a hand, and the gesture
was one of much grace and distinction, because Power
insensibly carried himself as a born leader of men.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just quit worrying, I tell you,&rdquo; he said calmly.
&ldquo;I understand. The boys will escort them to that
millionaire saloon. They&rsquo;ll be a lively crowd, of course;
but they won&rsquo;t see me, never fear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then he strode off, his spurs jingling in rhythm with
each long, athletic pace. He headed straight for a
narrow cleft in the hill at the back of the store, a cleft
locally known as the Gulch, and beyond it, on another
plateau sloping to the southeast, lay the Willard homestead.</p>

<p>MacGonigal watched the tall figure until it vanished
in the upward curving of the path. Then he
rolled the cigar between his heavy lips again until it
was securely lodged in the opposite corner of his
mouth; but the maneuver was wasted,&mdash;the cigar was
out,&mdash;and such a thing had not happened in twenty
years! To mark an unprecedented incident, he threw
away an unconsumed half.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s crazy ter have a last peep at Nancy,&rdquo; he communed.
&ldquo;An&rsquo; they&rsquo;d have made a bully fine pair, too,
ef it hadn&rsquo;t been fer that skunk Marten. Poor Derry!
Mighty good job I stopped home, or he&rsquo;d ha gone plumb
to hell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Of course, the storekeeper was talking to himself;
so he may not have said it, really. But he thought
it, and, theologically, that is as bad. Moreover, he might
have electrified Bison by his language that night were
he gifted with second sight; for he had seen the last
of the proud, self-contained yet light-hearted and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
generous-souled cavalier whom he had known and liked
as &ldquo;Derry&rdquo; Power. They were fated to meet again
many times, under conditions as varying as was ever
recorded in a romance of real life; but MacGonigal had
to find a place in his heart for a new man, because
&ldquo;Derry&rdquo; Power was dead&mdash;had died there in the open
doorway of the store&mdash;and a stranger named John
Darien Power reigned in his stead.</p>

<h2><small>CHAPTER II</small><br />

THE TERMS</h2>


<p>The Gulch was naked but unashamed, and lay in
a drowsy stupor. An easterly breeze, bringing coolness
elsewhere, here gathered radiated heat from gaunt
walls on which the sun had poured all day, and desiccating
gusts beat on Power&rsquo;s face like superheated
air gushing from a furnace. Not that the place was
an inferno&mdash;far from it. On a June day just a year
ago two young people had ridden up the rough trail
on their way to the Dolores ranch, and the girl had
called the man&rsquo;s attention to the exquisite coloring
of the rocks and the profusion of flowers which decked
every niche and crevice. It may be that they looked
then through eyes which would have tinted with rose
the dreariest of scenes; but even today, in another couple
of hours, when the sun was sinking over the mountain
range to the west, the Gulch would assuredly don
a marvelous livery of orange, and red, and violet. Each
stray clump of stunted herbage which had survived
the drought would make a brave show, and rock-mosses
which should be moist and green would not spoil the
picture because they were withered and brown or black.</p>

<p>But Power, despite a full share of the artist&rsquo;s temperament,
was blind to the fierce blending of color
which the cliffs offered in the blaze of sunlight. His
eyes were peering into his own soul, and he saw naught<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
there but dun despair and icy self-condemnation. For
he blamed himself for wrecking two lives. If Nancy
Willard could possibly find happiness as Hugh Marten&rsquo;s
wife, he might indeed have cursed the folly of hesitation
that lost her; but there would be the salving consciousness
that she, at least, would drink of the nectar
which wealth can buy in such Homeric drafts. But
he was denied the bitter-sweet recompense of altruism.
He knew Nancy, and he knew Marten, and he
was sure that the fairest wild flower which the Dolores
ranch had ever seen would wilt and pine in the exotic
atmosphere into which her millionaire husband would
plunge her.</p>

<p>Hugh Marten was a man of cold and crafty nature.
Success, and a close study of its essentials, had taught
him to be studiously polite, bland, even benignant, when
lavish display of these qualities suited his purposes.
But he could spring with the calculating ferocity of
a panther if thereby the object in view might be attained
more swiftly and with equal certainty. His upward
progress among the mining communities of Colorado,
New Mexico, and, more recently, California had
been meteoric&mdash;once it began. None suspected the
means until they saw the end; then angry and disappointed
rivals would compare notes, recognizing too
late how he had encouraged this group to fight that,
only to gorge both when his financial digestion was
ready for the meal. He had the faculty, common to
most of his type, of surrounding himself with able
lieutenants. Thus, John Darien Power came to him
with no stronger backing than a college degree in
metallurgy and a certificate of proficiency as a mining<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
engineer, credentials which an army of young Americans
can produce; but he discerned in this one young
man the master sense of the miner&rsquo;s craft, and promoted
him rapidly.</p>

<p>He paid well, too, gave excellent bonuses over and
above a high salary&mdash;was, in fact, a pioneer among
those merchant princes who discovered that a helper
is worth what he earns, not what he costs&mdash;and Power
was actually entitled, through his handling of the Sacramento
placer mine, to a sum large enough to warrant
marriage with the woman he loved. Not for one
instant had the assistant dreamed that his chief was
casting a covetous eye on Nancy Willard. She was
a girl of twenty, he a man looking ten years older
than the thirty-eight years he claimed. Apparently,
she was wholly unsuited to become the wife of a financial
magnate. She knew nothing of the outer maze
of society and politics; while it was whispered that
Marten would soon run for state governor, to be followed
by a senatorship, and, possibly, by an embassy.
To help such ambitious emprise he needed a skilled
partner, a woman of the world, a mate born and reared
in the purple, and none imagined, Power least of any,
that the vulture would swoop on the pretty little song-bird
which had emerged from the broken-down cage
of the Dolores ranch. For the place had been well
named. Misfortune had dogged its owner&rsquo;s footsteps
ever since the death of his wife ten years earlier, and
Francis Willard was buffeted by Fate with a kind of
persistent malevolence. Neighboring farms had been
rich in metals; his was bare. When other ranchers
won wealth by raising stock, he hardly held his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
own against disease, dishonest agents, and unfortunate
choice of markets. This present arid season had
even taken from him three-fourths of his store
cattle.</p>

<p>Power did not know yet how the marriage had been
brought to an issue so speedily. In time, no doubt,
he would fit together the pieces of the puzzle; but that
day his wearied brain refused to act. He might hazard
a vague guess that he had been misrepresented, that
his absence in California was construed falsely, that
the letters he wrote had never reached the girl&rsquo;s hands;
but he was conscious now only of a numb feeling of
gratitude that he had been saved from killing his
usurper, and of an overmastering desire to look once
more on Nancy&rsquo;s face before she passed out of his
life forever.</p>

<p>He climbed the Gulch to the divide. From that point
he could see the long, low buildings of the ranch, lying
forlornly in the midst of empty stockyards and scorched
grazing land; though the Dolores homestead itself
looked neither forlorn nor grief-stricken. A hundred
horses, or more, were tethered in the branding yard
near the house. Two huge tents had been brought
from Denver; the smoke of a field oven showed that
some professional caterer was busy; and a great company
of men, women, and children was gathered at
that very moment near the porch, close to which a
traveling carriage was drawn up. A spluttering <i>feu
de joie</i>, sounding in the still air like the sharp cracking
of a whip, announced that the departure of bride
and bridegroom was imminent; but the pair of horses
attached to the carriage reared and bucked owing to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
the shouting, and Power had a momentary glimpse of
a trim, neat figure, attired in biscuit-colored cloth,
and wearing a hat gay with red poppies, standing in
the veranda. Close at hand was a tall man dressed in
gray tweed.</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Hugh Marten were about to start on
their honeymoon trip to New York and Europe!</p>

<p>For an instant Power&rsquo;s eyes were blinded with tears;
but he brushed away the weakness with a savage gesture,
and examined the stark rocks on each side in
search of a nook whence he might see without being
seen. It was the careless glance of a man maddened
with well-nigh intolerable loss; yet, had he known how
much depended on his choice of a refuge, even in the
very crux of his grief and torment he would have given
more heed to it. As it was, he retreated a few paces,
until hidden from any chance eye which might rove that
way from the ranch, chose a break in the cliff where
an expert cragsman could mount forty feet without
difficulty, and finally threw himself at full length on
a ledge which sloped inward, and was overhung by
a mass of red granite, all cracked and blistered by
centuries of elemental war. Some stunted tufts of
alfalfa grass were growing on the outer lip of the
ledge. By taking off his sombrero, and peeping between
the dried stems, he could overlook the cavalcade
as it passed without anyone being the wiser.</p>

<p>The surface of the rock was so hot as to be almost
unbearable; but he was completely oblivious of any
sense of personal discomfort. That side of the Gulch
was in shadow now, and concealment was all he cared
for. He was sufficiently remote from the narrow track<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
to which the horses would necessarily be confined that
he ran no risk of yielding to some berserker fit of rage
if he encountered Marten&rsquo;s surprised scrutiny, when,
perchance, he might have flung an oath at the man
who had despoiled him, and thereby caused distress
to the woman he loved. To avoid that calamity, he
would have endured worse evils than the blistering
rock.</p>

<p>He remembered afterward that while he waited,
crouched there like some creature of the wild, his mind
was nearly a blank. He was conscious only of a dull
torpor of wrath and suffering. He had neither plan
nor hope for the future. His profession, which he
loved, had suddenly grown irksome. In curiously detached
mood, he saw the long procession of days in
the mines, in the mart, in the laboratory. And the
nights&mdash;ah, dear Heaven, the nights! What horror
of dreariness would come to him then! He seemed to
hear an inner voice bidding him abandon it all, and
hide in some remote corner of the world where none
knew him, and where every familiar sight and sound
would not remind him of Nancy Willard. Nancy Willard&mdash;she
was Nancy Marten now! He awoke to a
dim perception of his surroundings by hearing his
teeth grating. And even that trivial thing brought an
exquisite pain of memory; for Nancy, reading a book
one day, came across a passage in which some disappointed
rascal had &ldquo;ground his teeth in baffled rage,&rdquo;
and he had joined in her shout of glee at the notion
that anyone should express emotion so crudely. So,
then, a man might really vent his agony in that way!
Truly, one lived and learned, and this was certainly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
an afternoon during which he had acquired an intensive
knowledge of life and its vicissitudes.</p>

<p>But now the elfin screeching of excited cowboys, and
a continuous fusillade of revolvers fired in the air as
their owners raced alongside the lumbering coach, announced
that the wedded pair had begun their long
journey. The racket of yells and shooting, heightened
by weird sounds extracted from tin trumpets, bugles,
and horns, drew rapidly nearer, and, at any other
time, Power would have been amused and interested
by the sudden eruption of life in the canyon brought
about by this unwonted intrusion on its peace. A horse
or so, or a drove of steers, these were normal features
of existence, and no respectable denizen of the Gulch
would allow such trifles to trouble his or her alert wits
for a moment. But this tornado of pistol-shots and
bellowing was a very different matter, and coyotes,
jack-rabbits, a magnificent mountain sheep, a couple
of great lizards&mdash;in fact, all manner of furred and
scaly creatures&mdash;deserted lairs where they might have
remained in perfect security, scampered frantically to
other retreats, and doubtless cowered there till dusk.</p>

<p>A coyote raced up the cleft at the top of which
Power was hidden; but, ere ever he had seen his enemy,
man, he was aware of the hidden danger, and fled to
an untainted sanctuary elsewhere. He had hardly vanished
before the leading horsemen galloped into sight,
and soon a motley but highly picturesque regiment of
Westerners filled the trail to its utmost capacity. Both
men and horses were at home in this rugged land, and
raced over its inequalities at a pace which would have
brought down many a rider who thinks he is a devil<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
of a fellow when a mounted policeman gallops after
him in the park and cautions him sharply to moderate
his own and his steed&rsquo;s exuberance. Even in the joyous
abandonment of this typical western crowd there was
a species of order; for they took care not to incommode
the coach, a cumbersome vehicle, but the only
practicable conveyance of its kind on four wheels which
could be trusted to traverse that rock-strewn path. Its
heavy body was slung on stout leather bands, and the
wheels were low, set well apart, and moving on axles
calculated to withstand every sort of jolt and strain.
The driver was performing some excellent balancing
feats on his perch while he egged on a willing team
or exchanged yells with some other choice spirit who
tore ahead when the road permitted. Among the throng
were not a few women and girls from Bison. They rode
astride like their men folk, and their shrill voices
mingled cheerfully in the din.</p>

<p>Power was deaf and blind to the pandemonium and
its sprites: he had eyes only for the two people seated
in the coach. The ancient equipage owned low seats
and lofty windows, having been built during a period
when ladies&rsquo; headgear soared well above normal standards;
so its occupants were in full view, even at
the elevation from which the unseen observer looked
down.</p>

<p>Marten, a powerfully built man, of commanding
height and good physique, clean-shaven, though the
habit was far from general in the West at that date,
was evidently exerting himself to soothe and interest
his pallid companion. His swarthy face was flushed,
and its constant smile was effortless; for he had schooled<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
himself to adapt the mood to the hour. As the personnel
of the cavalcade changed with each headlong
gallop or sudden halt, he nodded affably to the men,
or bowed with some distinction to the women; for Marten
knew, or pretended that he knew, every inhabitant
of Bison.</p>

<p>His wife knew them too, without any pretense; but
she kept her eyes studiously lowered, and, if she spoke,
used monosyllables, and those scarcely audible, for
Marten had obviously to ask twice what she had said
even during the fleeting seconds when the pair were
visible to Power. Her features were composed almost
to apathy; but the watcher from the cliff, who could
read the slightest change of expression in a face as
mobile to the passing mood as a mountain tarn to
the breeze, felt that she was fulfilling a compact and
holding her emotions in tense subjection.</p>

<p>He hoped, he prayed, with frenzied craving of the
most high gods, that she might be moved to lift her
eyes to his aery; but the petition was denied, and the
last memory vouchsafed of her was the sight of her
gloved hands clasped on her lap and holding a few
sprigs of white heather. Now, it was a refined malignity
of Fate which revealed that fact just then, because
heather does not grow in Colorado, and the girl
had culled her simple little bouquet from a plant which
Power had given her. Once, in Denver, he had rendered
some slight service to an expatriated Scot, and,
when a sister from Perth joined her brother, bringing
with her a pot of Highland soil in which bloomed the
shrub dear to every Scottish heart, Power was offered
a cutting &ldquo;for luck.&rdquo; Great was Nancy Willard&rsquo;s<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
delight at the gift; for, like the majority of her sex,
she yielded to pleasant superstition, and the fame of
white heather as a mascot has spread far beyond the
bounds of Great Britain.</p>

<p>Power might well have cried aloud in his pain when
he discovered that his lost love had thought of him at
the moment she was leaving her old home. Perhaps
he did utter some tortured plaint: he never knew, because
of what happened the instant after Nancy and
her spray of heather were reft from his straining
vision.</p>

<p>One-thumb Jake, who had loitered at the ranch for
a farewell drink, rode up at a terrific pace, pulled his
bronco on to its haunches alongside the coach, and
by way of salute, fired three shots from a revolver as
quickly as finger could press trigger.</p>

<p>The first bullet sang through the air not more than
an inch above Power&rsquo;s forehead. He recalled afterward
a slight stirring of his hair caused by the passing
of the missile, which spat viciously against the wall
of rock some ten feet above the ledge. The next two
bullets struck higher, and their impact evidently disturbed
the equipoise of a mass of stone already disintegrated
by frost, because more than a ton of d&eacute;bris
crashed down, pinning Power to the ledge and nearly
pounding the life out of him. The resultant cloud of
dust probably helped to render him unconscious. At
any rate, he lay there without word or movement, and,
if he were dead, his bones might have rested many
a year in that strange tomb unless the curiosity of some
passerby was aroused by a flock of quarreling vultures&mdash;a
spectacle so common in cattle-land that the way<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>farer
does not deviate a hand&rsquo;s breadth from his path
because of it.</p>

<p>Nancy heard the thunder of the falling rocks, and
looked out. The dust pall told her exactly what had
occurred, though the jubilant congratulation of the
shooter by the driver would have explained matters
in any event.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good fer you, Jake!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;Gosh! when
you&rsquo;re fed up on cowpunchin&rsquo; you kin go minin&rsquo; wid
a gun!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She saw, too, what many others saw: A rattlesnake,
rudely dislodged from some deep crevice, emerged from
the heap of rubbish, stopped suddenly, swelled and
puffed in anger, rattled its tail-plates, and was obviously
primed for combat. It seemed to change its
mind, however, when a fourth bullet from the cowboy&rsquo;s
revolver grazed a big brown rhomboid which offered
a fair target just below the curved neck. There was
another shower of dust and granite chips, and, when
this subsided, the reptile had vanished.</p>

<p>Nancy sat back in the coach. Amid a chorus of
laughter and jeers at what his critics were pleased
to regard as bad marksmanship, Jake spurred his horse
into a gallop again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What was it?&rdquo; inquired Marten. Being on the
other side of the vehicle, he was unaware of the cause
of this slight commotion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing, really,&rdquo; she said dully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, come now, little woman&mdash;the crowd would not
yelp at Jake for no reason.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, his shots brought down some loose stones,
and a rattler appeared in the middle of the heap. It<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
showed fight, too; but made off when Jake fired
again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, is that all? There wouldn&rsquo;t be a snake on
the ranch if your father had kept a few pigs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor old dad couldn&rsquo;t keep anything&mdash;not even
me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her listless tone might have annoyed a weaker man;
but Marten only laughed pleasantly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should be very unhappy if he had insisted on
keeping you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Of course, you hate having
to part from him, and from a place where you have
lived during a few careless years; but you will soon
learn to love the big world to which I am taking you.
Colorado in June is all very well; but it can&rsquo;t begin
to compare with London in July, the Engadine in
August, and Paris in September. Don&rsquo;t forget
that the proper study of mankind is man&mdash;and
woman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And so, the line was dangled skilfully before her
eyes, and the spell whispered gently into her ears,
while she, mute and distraught, wondered whether the
dear memories of Colorado would ever weaken and grow
dim. Then she thought of Derry Power, and a film
came over her blue eyes; but she bit her under-lip in
brave endeavor, and forced a smile at some passing
friend.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Power did not remain unconscious many minutes.
The last straggler among the mounted contingent was
clattering through the canyon when the man who had
been near death three times in the same number of
seconds awoke to a burden of physical pain which,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
for the time, effectually banished all other considerations.</p>

<p>At first he hardly realized where he was or what
had happened. He was half choked with dust, and
the effort of his lungs to secure pure air undoubtedly
helped to restore his senses. It was humanly impossible
to curb the impulse toward self-preservation, and
he tried at once to free his limbs of an intolerable
weight. He was able to move slightly; but the agony
which racked his left leg warned him that the limb
was either broken or badly sprained. His profession had
often brought similar accidents within his ken, and
indications of a further probable subsidence among the
fallen stones&mdash;though the warning was so slight as to
be negligible to the ordinary ear&mdash;told him that he
must be wary, or a second avalanche might kill him
outright.</p>

<p>By now the air was breathable, and he could see into
the deserted Gulch. He was well aware that no one
might be expected to pass that way during the next
hour. Before returning to the feast in preparation at
the ranch, the escort would await the departure of
the train; while those who had not taken part in the
procession would certainly remain there until darkness
ended the festivities. So he had the choice of two evils.
He could either possess his soul in patience until the
mounted contingent began to straggle back, or risk
another rock-fall.</p>

<p>Naturally, he understood the cause and extent of
the mishap, and his present mood did not brook the
delay entailed by the safer course. Raising head and
shoulders by lifting himself on both hands, he con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>trived
to twist round on his left side, and surveyed
the position. It was bad enough, in all conscience, but
might have been worse. By far the largest piece of
granite had been the last to drop, and he saw that
it was poised precariously on some smaller lumps. Any
attempt to withdraw either of his legs (the left one
was broken, beyond a doubt) would disturb its balance,
and, if it toppled on his body, he would be imprisoned
without hope of relief by his own effort. Rising
still higher, though each inch gained cost a twinge of
agony that brought sweat from every pore, he achieved
a half-sitting, half-lolling posture. Then, applying his
miner&rsquo;s aptitude to the dynamics of the problem, he
packed the threatening boulder with others until it
was wedged into partial security.</p>

<p>He had barely finished this task, which only a splendid
vitality enabled him to carry through, when his
eye was caught by something in the new face of the
rock which seemed to fascinate him for a second or
two. Then his mouth twisted in a rictus of dreadful
mirth, so wrung was he with pain, yet so overcome by
what he had seen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So that is the price!&rdquo; he almost shouted, accompanying
the words with others which seldom fell from
his lips. &ldquo;Those are the terms of surrender, eh? Well,
it is a compact made in hell; but I&rsquo;ll keep it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>After that, his actions savored of a maniac&rsquo;s cunning
rather than the desire of a sane man to save his
own life. Slowly, with never a groan, he extracted
both legs from beneath the pile of stones. The spurs
were his chief difficulty. One was held so tightly that
he had to tear his foot out by main force; but luckily<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
it was the right foot, or he could not have done it.
Something had to give way under the strain, and ultimately
the spur was released by the yielding of a strap
at a buckle. The torture he suffered must have been
intense; but he uttered no sound save an occasional sob
of effort, when all the strength of hands and wrists
were needed to move one or other of the chunks of
granite without dislodging the grim monster he had
chained.</p>

<p>At last he was free. He felt the injured limb, which
was almost benumbed, and ascertained beyond doubt
that it was fractured below the knee. But he was safe
enough, even though the precarious structure of stones
collapsed, and any other victim of like circumstances
would have been content with that tremendous achievement.
Not so John Darien Power.</p>

<p>The mere fact that he need now only lie still until
assistance reached him seemed to lash him into a fresh
panic of energy. After a hasty glance into the canyon,
obviously to find out whether or not anyone was approaching,
he began to throw pieces of d&eacute;bris into the
fissure left bare by the fall. When he had exhausted
the store within reach he crawled to a new supply, and
piled stone upon stone until the rock wall was covered
to a height of more than two feet. Even then he was
not satisfied; but moved a second time, his apparent
object, if any, being to give the scene of his accident
the semblance of a stone slide.</p>

<p>Finally, he did the maddest thing of all, lowering
himself down the cleft with a rapidity that was almost
inconceivable in a man with a broken leg. On reaching
the level of the trail he slipped and fell. That<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
drew a queer sort of subdued shriek from his parched
throat; but, after a moment of white agony, he began
to crawl in the direction of the ranch. He chose
that way deliberately, because the slope was downhill,
and not so rough as in the upper part of the
gorge. With care, for he meant to avoid another slip,
but never halting, he dragged his crippled body fully
a hundred yards from the foot of the ledge. Then
he crept into the shade, at a spot where the side
of the Gulch rose sheer for twenty feet, turned over
on his back, and lay quietly.</p>

<p>He had almost reached the end of his tether. His
face was drawn, and disfigured with dirt and perspiration.
His eyelids dropped involuntarily, as though to
shut out a world which had suddenly become savagely
hostile; but his lips moved in a wan grimace, a
wry parody of the generous, warm-hearted smile that
people had learned to associate with Derry Power.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My poor Nancy!&rdquo; he murmured brokenly. &ldquo;My
dear lost sweetheart! If the Fates have bought you
from me, I was no party to the deal, and I&rsquo;ll exact
the last cent on it&mdash;I swear that by your own sprig
of white heather! Someone will pay, in blood and tears,
or I&rsquo;ll know the reason why! Yes, someone will pay!
Power versus Marten, with the devil as arbitrator!
Marten has won the first round; but I&rsquo;ll take it to a
higher court. I&rsquo;ll choke the life out of him yet&mdash;choke&mdash;the
beast!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Of course, Power was light-headed.</p>

<h2><small>CHAPTER III</small><br />

SHOWING HOW POWER ACQUIRED
A LIMP.</h2>


<p>If any sentient thought loomed vaguely through the
haze of pain and exhaustion which enwrapped Power
like a pall, it was that he would probably lie there
a long time before help came; yet he had hardly uttered
that half-delirious vow before he was aware of
an animal snuffing cautiously around him, and the
knowledge galvanized him into a species of activity.
He turned on his right side, and raised himself on
one hand, the fingers of which closed instinctively on
a heavy stone as supplying a weapon of defense.</p>

<p>But his eyes rested only on a dog, a dapper fox-terrier,
whose furtive curiosity changed instantly to
alarm, as it retreated some distance, and barked excitedly.
Then Power saw the animal&rsquo;s master, a
stranger, or, at any rate, a newcomer, in the district,
a man of about his own age, who rode a
compactly-built pony with the careless ease of good
horsemanship, and was dressed <i>de rigueur</i>, except for
the broad-brimmed hat demanded by the Colorado sun.</p>

<p>Evidently the horseman was not surprised at finding
someone lying in the Gulch.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hullo!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Had a spill?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Power tried to speak; but the dust and grit in his
throat rendered his words almost inaudible. Then the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
other understood that if, as he imagined, copious
drafts of champagne had caused some unaccustomed
head to reel, the outcome was rather more serious than
a mere tumble. He urged the pony rapidly nearer,
and dismounted, and a glance at Power&rsquo;s face dispelled
his earlier notion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo; he inquired in a sympathetic tone.
&ldquo;Are you hurt?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Power&rsquo;s second effort at ordered speech was
more successful. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;My leg is
broken.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, that&rsquo;s too bad. Which leg?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The left.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Were you thrown?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The stranger noted the soiled condition of the injured
man&rsquo;s clothing. He saw that a spur had been
torn off, and among the drying dirt on Power&rsquo;s face
and hands were some more ominous streaks; since a
man may not squirm in agony beneath a shower of
jagged granite and escape some nasty abrasions of
the skin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; he said gently. &ldquo;You fell from up there
somewhere,&rdquo; and he looked at the cliff, &ldquo;tripped over
that missing spur, I suppose. Well, what&rsquo;s to be
done? Were you at the ranch? I didn&rsquo;t happen to
come across you. Shall I take you there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, please&mdash;to Bison&mdash;to MacGonigal&rsquo;s store.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes. But it&rsquo;s an awkward business. You can&rsquo;t
possibly hold yourself in the saddle. Can you stand
on one leg, even for a few seconds?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I fear not. I&rsquo;m about done.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But if I carry you to the face of the rock there,
and prop you against it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ll do that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This friend in need pulled the reins over the pony&rsquo;s
head, passed them through his arm, lifted Power, not
without some difficulty, and brought him to a spot
where the precipice rose like a wall.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There you are!&rdquo; he gasped; for he was of slender
proportions, and Power&rsquo;s weight was deceptive,
owing to his perfect physical fitness. &ldquo;Now I&rsquo;ll mount,
and hold you as comfortably as I can; but I don&rsquo;t know
how this fat geegee will behave under a double load,
so I must have my hands free at first. Will you grip
me tight? It may hurt like sin&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go right ahead!&rdquo; said Power.</p>

<p>Sure enough, when the pony found what was expected
of him, he snorted, raised head and tail, and
trotted a few indignant paces.</p>

<p>The rider soon quieted him to a walk; but they were
abreast of the scene of Power&rsquo;s accident before he
was aware that the man clasping his body had
uttered neither word nor groan, though the prancing
of the horse must have caused him intense
agony.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By Jove!&rdquo; came the involuntary cry, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve got
some sand! I&rsquo;d have squealed like a stuck pig if I
was asked to endure that. Who are you? I&rsquo;m Robert
H. Benson, Mr. Marten&rsquo;s private secretary.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My name is Power,&rdquo; was the answer, in a thick
murmur.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bower?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;Power.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not John Darien Power, who was at Sacramento!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gee whizz! I&rsquo;ve written you several letters. You
remember my initials, R. H. B.?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can you talk? Say if you&rsquo;d rather not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no. It&rsquo;s all right. Anyhow&mdash;I&rsquo;d&mdash;sooner&mdash;try.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does the boss know you&rsquo;re here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess not. I wrote him&mdash;to Denver; but he&rsquo;s been
engaged&mdash;otherwise.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ra-ther! Getting wed. You&rsquo;ve heard? I&rsquo;m sure
you&rsquo;re as much surprised as any of us. You could have
knocked me down with a feather when he told me
why I was wired to come West by next train from New
York. &lsquo;I want you to take hold,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m off
to Europe for six months on my wedding trip.&rsquo; That
was the day before yesterday, and here he&rsquo;s gone
already! I had a sort of notion, too, that our
beloved employer would never take unto himself a
wife, or, if he did, that the U. S. A. would hear
about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A hard smile illuminated the pallor of Power&rsquo;s face.
&ldquo;Marten doesn&rsquo;t hire a brass band when he has any
startling proposition in mind,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>Benson laughed. He was a cheerful, outspoken
youngster&mdash;exactly the kind of private secretary the
secretive millionaire might have been expected to avoid
like the plague, if Marten had not chosen him deliberately
because of those very qualities.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he chuckled. &ldquo;You and I know that, don&rsquo;t<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
we? But signing on for a wife is a different matter
to securing an option on a placer mine. I should have
thought there would be things doing when H. M. joined
the noble army of benedicts, especially after he had
sorted out such a daisy.... Sorry, Power! The peak
of this saddle must be dashed uncomfortable. And,
perhaps, I&rsquo;m not carrying you to rights. One ought
to be taught these things. Now, a cavalry soldier
would be trained in the art of picking up a wounded
mate, and in carrying him, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not far. I can last out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mind having a pow-wow? Guess you
prefer it? You knew Miss Willard, I suppose? By
the way, were you coming to the wedding?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. I am here by chance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, of course, I rather fancied that. If I had
been asked offhand how much time that Sacramento
job would use up, I should have said another three
months, at least. Is all the machinery there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pumps, and all?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sorry if I appear inquisitive, but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The pumps are working. I got a hustle on the
contractors.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Great Scott! I should think so, indeed. They&rsquo;ll
make a song about it in Chicago. Have you sent
in the consulting engineer&rsquo;s certificate?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. It&rsquo;s in Denver.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll tell you something that is good for
broken legs. The boss was talking of you only yesterday.
He said you were to collect five thousand<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
dollars when that placer mine was in shape. He forgets
nothing, does he?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Power&rsquo;s stricken state was sufficient excuse for any
seeming lack of gratitude, and his rescuer&rsquo;s mind
reverted to the more immediate topic of the marriage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I asked if you were acquainted with Miss Willard,&rdquo;
he went on. &ldquo;Naturally, you must have seen
her often. She was born and bred on this ranch, I
believe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bred here, yes; but born near Pueblo, I&rsquo;ve been
told.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, isn&rsquo;t she a peach?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A pretty girl, very.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rather quiet, though. Kind of subdued, to my
taste. Life on the Dolores ranch must have been a
mighty tough proposition, I imagine. But she&rsquo;ll
brighten up as Mrs. Marten. They all do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is Marten a sultan, then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The private secretary chortled over the joke. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
jiggered if I could have pulled off a wheeze like that
if I had been chucked off a cliff and my leg was
out of gear!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;No, my boy, Marten has
a clean record in that respect. I&rsquo;ve never known him
look twice at any woman; though he&rsquo;s had chances
in plenty. What I mean is that these sweet young
things who have never seen a real store, and don&rsquo;t know
sable from dyed rabbit, wake up amazingly when they&rsquo;re
Mrs. Somebody of Somewhere. Look at Mrs. Van
Pieter! A year ago she was keeping tab on people
who hired her father&rsquo;s canoes at Portland, Maine,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
and it&rsquo;s hardly a week since I met her in Tiffany&rsquo;s,
matching pearls at a thousand dollars a
pick.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What were you doing in Tiffany&rsquo;s?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The question seemed to take Benson by surprise;
but, though he might be talkative as a parrot, he did
not discuss his employer&rsquo;s personal behests.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Having a look around,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought you might be buying Mrs. Marten&rsquo;s wedding
gift,&rdquo; went on Power.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, as a guesser, you&rsquo;d come out first in a prize
competition.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was&mdash;just&mdash;curiosity. I wondered&mdash;what&mdash;Marten
gave her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s no secret. She wore it today. A collarette
of diamonds.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, a collar! Has it a golden padlock? Is there
a leash?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, now! Aren&rsquo;t you feeling pretty bad? We&rsquo;re
going downhill, and it jolts. But we&rsquo;re near that store.
What&rsquo;s the name?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;MacGonigal&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To be sure. I had forgotten. Queer fellow, the
proprietor. Looks like a character out of one of Bret
Harte&rsquo;s novels. Is there a doctor in Bison?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;of a sort. He&rsquo;s sober, some days.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s hope this is one of the days.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Drunk or sober, he can pull a leg straight and
tie it in splints.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But it ought to be fixed in plaster of Paris.
That&rsquo;s the latest dodge. Then you&rsquo;ll be able to hobble
about in less than a month. Why, here&rsquo;s the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
storekeeper himself. He must have been looking this
way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was expecting me. I promised to meet him
about four o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;re on time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thanks to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, come off! A lot I&rsquo;ve done; though I do believe
it was better to keep up a steady flow of chatter
than to be asking you every ten yards how you were
feeling.... Hi, there! I&rsquo;ve brought your friend
Power; but he&rsquo;s in rather bad shape. Had a fall up
in the Gulch, and one leg is crocked.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The pony needed no urging to halt, and Power, whose
head was sunk between his shoulders, looked as if he
would become insensible again at the mere thought of
renewed exertion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A fall!&rdquo; repeated MacGonigal, moving ponderously
to the near side, and peering up into Power&rsquo;s
face. &ldquo;Well, ef I ain&rsquo;t dog-goned! What sort of a
fall?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just the common variety&mdash;downward,&rdquo; said Benson.
&ldquo;His left leg is broken below the knee. Can
you hold him until I hitch this fiery steed to a post?
Then I&rsquo;ll help carry him to a bedroom. After that,
if I can be of any use, tell me what to do, or where
to go&mdash;for the doctor, I mean.&rdquo;</p>

<p>By this time MacGonigal had assured himself that
Power&rsquo;s clothing was not full of bullet-holes, and he
began to believe that Benson, whom he recognized,
was telling the truth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give him to me,&rdquo; he said, with an air of quiet
self-confidence. &ldquo;Back of some sugar casks in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
warehouse thar you&rsquo;ll find a stretcher. Bring that
along, an&rsquo; we&rsquo;ll lay him in the veranda till the doc
shows up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Soon the hardly conscious sufferer was reposing with
some degree of comfort in a shaded nook with his back
to the light. MacGonigal, whose actions were
strangely deft-handed and gentle for so stout a man,
was persuading him to drink some brandy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He has collapsed all at once,&rdquo; said Benson
commiseratingly. &ldquo;He perked up and chatted in
great shape while I was bringing him through the
Gulch.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did he now?... Yes, Derry, it&rsquo;s me, Mac. Just
another mouthful.... An&rsquo; what did he talk about,
Mr. Benson?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, mostly about the wedding, I guess.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nat&rsquo;rally. He&rsquo;d be kind of interested in hearin&rsquo;
how Marten had scooped up Nancy Willard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Some acrid quality in the storekeeper&rsquo;s tone must
have pierced the fog which had settled on Power&rsquo;s
brain. He raised a hand to push away the glass held
to his lips.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, I&rsquo;ve only secured a broken leg, Mac,&rdquo; he
murmured, smiling into the anxious face bent over
him. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to be doped as well. Perhaps
Mr. Benson will mount that nag of his, and bring
Peters.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look-a here, Derry, hadn&rsquo;t we better send to
Denver?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. Peters has set dozens of legs and arms.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess he&rsquo;s back at the ranch. He went thar,
an&rsquo; I hain&rsquo;t seen him among the crowd.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is he a tall, red-whiskered chap, with a nose that
needs keeping out of the sun?&rdquo; broke in Benson.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yep. That&rsquo;s him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, he&rsquo;s there now&mdash;and&mdash;not so bad. Does he
really understand bone-setting?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure. He&rsquo;s all to rights when not too much in
likker.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have him here in half an hour.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Benson whistled to the dog, and they heard the
clattering hoofbeats of the cob&rsquo;s hurried departure.
MacGonigal brought a chair, and sat by his friend&rsquo;s
side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was it a reel tumble, Derry?&rdquo; he asked softly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Seems like it, Mac. Don&rsquo;t worry your kind old
fat head. No one saw me. Let me lie quiet now,
there&rsquo;s a good soul. I&rsquo;ve done enough thinking for
today.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, Boy, kin yer smoke?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;not till the doc is through.&rdquo;</p>

<p>MacGonigal bit the end off a cigar, bit it viciously,
as if he were annoyed at it. Then he struck a match
by drawing it sharply along the side of his leg, and
lit the cigar; but not another word did he utter until
a thunder of hoofs disturbed the hot silence of the
afternoon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Guess that&rsquo;s some of the boys comin&rsquo; from the
depot,&rdquo; whispered Mac. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll not suspicion you&rsquo;re
here, Derry, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll soon have a stampede by tellin&rsquo;
&rsquo;em the doc is loose among the bottles.&rdquo;</p>

<p>True to his promise, he got rid of the thirsty ones
quickly; for this smaller batch had not even awaited
the departure of the train.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Air you awake, Derry?&rdquo; he inquired, when he had
crept back softly to his chair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this yarn about One-thumb Jake shootin&rsquo;
a rattler?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;don&rsquo;t know. He didn&rsquo;t shoot me, Mac. I got
slammed on a rock, good and hard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I on&rsquo;y axed because I&rsquo;m nearly fed up with Jake
an&rsquo; his gun-play.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, quit it, you sleuth. Jake wouldn&rsquo;t pull his
gun on me, not even at Marten&rsquo;s bidding.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He kin be the biggest damn fool in Bison when
he&rsquo;s loaded. Anyhow, I&rsquo;ll take your say-so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was another period of quietude, when brooding
thought sat heavy on MacGonigal, and pain
gnawed Power with its sharpest tooth. Then came the
sound of galloping horses again, and Benson appeared,
guiding a big man who rolled in his walk; for the
fast canter had stirred many varieties of alcohol
in an overburdened system. The private secretary&rsquo;s
voice was raised in order that the others might
hear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would advise you to bandage the limb sufficiently
to give Mr. Power some sort of ease until Dr.
Stearn comes from Denver,&rdquo; he was urging. &ldquo;I am
sure that Mr. Marten would wish this case to be attended
by his own doctor, and I know that Dr. Stearn
attends him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stearn! What does that old mutt know about
surgery?&rdquo; shouted Peters. &ldquo;I could set a compound
fracture while he was searching around for his eyeglasses....
Hullo, Mac! You&rsquo;re always the right<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
man in the right place. Bring me a highball, to clear
the dust out of the pipes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You jest fix Derry first, Peters, an&rsquo; you kin hev
two highballs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The red-whiskered man, whose medical degree was
a blend of sheer impudence and a good deal of rough-and-ready
experience, knew MacGonigal so well that
he did not attempt to argue.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; he said sulkily. &ldquo;Break up an egg
box, and saw it into eighteen-inch lengths, four inches
wide. You have a roll of lint and scissors? I&rsquo;ll rip
up his trousers, and have a look at the place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His actions were decided, but somewhat awkward.
When Power winced because of a careless handling of
the injured limb, he only guffawed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nips you a bit!&rdquo; he grunted. &ldquo;Of course it does.
I&rsquo;d like to know what you expected. Did you fancy
you could flop over the Gulch like a crow?... Oh,
here we are! Just an ordinary smash. Hurry up with
those splints, Mac. Now, just set your teeth and
grin hard while I pull.... There! Did you hear
it? I&rsquo;ll not hurt you more than I can help while I
do the dressing. Got any bromide in that den of yours,
Mac? Well, give him a ten-grain dose every three
hours till he sleeps. Get the rest of his clothes off,
keep him in bed for three weeks, and the rest may be
left safely to Nature. Gee whizz! I&rsquo;m chewing mud.
Where in hell do you keep your whisky?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Doctor&rdquo; Peters had a professional manner which
did not inspire confidence; but he seemed to understand
what he was about, and Benson, when he could
be of no further service, went to the reduction mill,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
where he had business which detained him until a
late hour. Next morning, on his way to Denver, he
called at the store, and visited Power, who was feeling
a great deal better, and was confident that the damaged
limb would soon be as sound as ever.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope you won&rsquo;t think it necessary to trouble
Mr. Marten with any report of my accident,&rdquo; went
on the invalid. &ldquo;You see, in a sort of a way, it happened
in connection with his marriage, as I was watching
the festivities when it happened&mdash;had my eyes anywhere
but where they ought to be, I suppose&mdash;and if
his wife came to hear of it she might take it to heart.
Sometimes a woman has odd notions about such things
occurring on her wedding day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Right you are,&rdquo; agreed Benson cheerfully.</p>

<p>A remark dropped by the manager of the mill had
supplied a reason for the young engineer&rsquo;s interest in
the marriage, and he had come to the conclusion that
the sooner the whole affair was forgotten the better
it would be for all parties.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be in Denver till September or thereabouts;
but I&rsquo;ll be seeing you long before then,&rdquo; he continued.
&ldquo;What about squaring your account? I think I have
all the details in the office.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pay what is coming to me by check to Smith &amp;
Moffat&rsquo;s bank,&rdquo; said Power. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll let me know
when they get the money, and you can mail a receipt
here for my signature. By the way, I wish to resign
my position on Marten&rsquo;s staff as from yesterday.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sorry to hear that. Do you really mean it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll put that through, also. Goodby, old<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
chap, and good luck. You&rsquo;ll be well looked after,
I suppose?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t be in better hands than Mac&rsquo;s. If he
didn&rsquo;t own a hard head, his big heart would have ruined
him long ago.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;An unusual combination,&rdquo; laughed Benson, and his
eyes met Power&rsquo;s quizzically. &ldquo;Well, so long! Let
me know if I can do anything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Beyond the purely business formalities connected
with the payment of Power&rsquo;s salary and the acceptance
of his resignation, Benson heard little of him
until ten days later, when a telegram reached him
in the early morning. It was from MacGonigal, and
read:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t like the look of Power&rsquo;s leg. Send doctor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That afternoon Benson brought Dr. Stearn to the
store, and MacGonigal explained that from some remark
grunted by Peters when quite sober, and from
personal observation, he was not satisfied with the
appearance of Power&rsquo;s injured limb. The doctor, a
fully qualified medical man, was very wroth with
Peters when he had made a brief examination of the
patient.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is the work of an incompetent quack,&rdquo; he said
angrily. &ldquo;Whoever the man may be, he is the worst
sort of idiot&mdash;the sort that knows a little of what
he is doing. The splints and bandaging have served
their purpose only too well, because callous is forming
already. Unless you wish to have one leg half an inch
shorter than the other during the rest of your life,
Mr. Power, you must let me put you under ether.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; came the calm-voiced question.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;To put it plainly, your leg should be broken
again, and properly set.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is wrong with it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know you have two bones in that part of
the leg which is below the knee, the tibia and the fibula?
Well, they were broken&mdash;by a blow, was it? No, a
fall&mdash;well, they practically amount to the same thing,
though there are indications that this injury was
caused by a blow&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He fell off one rock onto another, doctor,&rdquo; put in
Benson.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes! That accounts for it. As I was saying,
they were broken slantwise, and now, instead of being
in correct apposition, the upper parts override the
lower ones. Do you follow?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Suppose they are not interfered with, will they
heal all right?&rdquo; said Power.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Y-yes,&rdquo; came the grudging admission; &ldquo;but
you&rsquo;ll walk with a limp.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bar that, the left leg will be as strong as the right
one?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stronger, in that particular place. Nature does
some first-rate grafting, when the stock is young and
exceptionally healthy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Power smiled, almost with the compelling good-humor
of other days. &ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll limp along, Doctor,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;I have things to do, and this enforced waste
of time is the worst feature of the whole business. It
is very good of you to come out here, and more than
kind of Mr. Benson to accompany you; but I won&rsquo;t, if
I can avoid it, endure another ten days like the sample
I have just passed through.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll regret your decision later. There&rsquo;s no
means of adding that half inch afterward, you
know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I quite understand, Doctor. It&rsquo;s a limp for life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dr. Stearn felt the calf muscles and tendons again,
and pressed the region of the fracture with skilled
gentleness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pity,&rdquo; he growled. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve made a wonderful
recovery. If, when you are able to hobble about,
you meet this rascal, Peters, and shoot him, call me
as a witness in your behalf. It would be a clear case
of justifiable homicide!&rdquo;</p>

<p>So that is how John Darien Power acquired the
somewhat jerky movement which characterizes his walk
today; though the cause of it is blurred by the mists
of a quarter of a century. The red-whiskered Peters
was shot long ago, not by Power, but by an infuriated
miner from whose jaw he had wrenched two sound
teeth before discovering the decayed stump which led
to this display of misplaced energy. It was well that
such impostors should be swept out of the townlets
of Colorado, even if the means adopted for their suppression
were drastic. They wrought untold mischief
by their pretensions, and brought hundreds of men
and women to needless death. They did some little
good, perhaps, in communities where physicians and
surgeons were few and far between; but their rough
and partly successful carpentry of the human frame
did not atone for the misery they inflicted in cases which
demanded a delicately exact and scientific diagnosis.
At any rate, they have gone, never to be seen again
in Colorado, and the precise manner of their departure,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
whether by rum, or lead, or wise and far-reaching laws,
does not concern this narrative.</p>

<p>What does concern it most intimately is the first
use Power made of his limping steps; for upon their
direction and daily increasing number depended the
whole of his subsequent history. Life still held for
him certain rare and noteworthy phases&mdash;developments
which, when viewed through the vista of many years,
seemed as inevitable and preordained as the ordered
sequence of a Greek tragedy. Yet, on the day he
hobbled out into the sunshine again, it was just the spin
of a coin whether he rode to the Dolores ranch or
took train for Denver, and it is safe to say that had
he done the one thing instead of the other his future
career must have been drawn into an entirely different
channel.</p>

<p>At least, that is the way men reason when they review
the past, and single out some trivial act which
apparently governed their destinies; whereat, in all
probability, the gods smile pityingly, for the lives of
some men cannot be the outcome of idle chance, and
John Darien Power&rsquo;s life was assuredly no commonplace
one.</p>

<h2><small>CHAPTER IV</small><br />

THE SUDDEN RISE OF PETER
<span class="smcap">MacGONIGAL</span></h2>


<p>A four-wheeled buggy, with springs, the only
vehicle of its kind in Bison, had been hired for Power&rsquo;s
first outing. During a whole week toward the
close of July he had stumped about on a crutch, and,
when the great day arrived that he was able to crawl
slowly to and fro in the veranda with the aid of a
stick, he announced to the watchful MacGonigal that
henceforth he was &ldquo;on the job again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On that memorable occasion, while Derry was
showing off the new-found accomplishment of walking,
an elderly man, white-haired and wiry, but of small
stature, rode by on a mettlesome mustang. Power&rsquo;s
face grew hard when he met the rider&rsquo;s stare of astonishment;
but the expression fled instantly, and he waved
a friendly greeting, which, however, received the curtest
of responses, while the horse unexpectedly found
his head free for a canter.</p>

<p>MacGonigal, whose big eyes lost nothing within
range, noted the bare nod which acknowledged Power&rsquo;s
salute.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Old man Willard held out the marble mitt that-a
time, Derry,&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>Power did not reply for a moment. When he answered,
he quoted Dryden&rsquo;s couplet:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>

<p class="poem">
&ldquo;Forgiveness to the injured doth belong;<br />
But they ne&rsquo;er pardon who have done the wrong.&rdquo;<br />
</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good fer you, Derry!&rdquo; exclaimed the storekeeper
appreciatively. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve often wondered what you was
connin&rsquo; to yerself up thar,&rdquo; and he jerked his head
in the direction of Power&rsquo;s bedroom; &ldquo;but I never
allowed it was po&rsquo;try.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You were not mistaken, Mac. I was hard at work
on dry prose. Those lines are not mine. They were
written before Colorado was christened, and they will
be true until men attain the millennium.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Huh!&rdquo;</p>

<p>MacGonigal took refuge in a noncommittal grunt,
because he fancied that the millennium was the name
of a Chicago vaudeville house, and, somehow, the notion
did not seem to fit into its right place in the
conversation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For all that,&rdquo; mused Power aloud, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll call on
Mr. Francis Willard, tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So this resolution explained the light conveyance
standing outside the store next morning. Power
was in the act of settling himself as comfortably as
might be beside the driven, when One-thumb Jake galloped
down the slope leading from the Gulch. The
cowboy pulled up in the approved style of his tribe,
swung out of the saddle, and banged into the veranda
a decrepit portmanteau, which he had been carrying
in the thumbless hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Room an&rsquo; drink fer a single gent!&rdquo; he shouted.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m an orfin, I am, a pore weak critter slung out inter
a crool world!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re never leaving the Willard outfit, Jake?&rdquo;
said Power, who might well be surprised, since the man
had been connected with the Dolores ranch since the
first lot of cattle was turned loose on its pastures.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s about the size of it,&rdquo; said the other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The old man says, &lsquo;Git!&rsquo; an&rsquo; I got.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No reason?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wall, if you squeeze it outer me, I&rsquo;ll be squoze.
In a sort of a way, it had ter do with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;With me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir. The boss says ter me yestiddy, &lsquo;Why is
Derry Power hangin&rsquo; roun&rsquo; Mac&rsquo;s?&rsquo; Says I, &lsquo;He bruk
his leg.&rsquo; &lsquo;Pity he didn&rsquo;t break his neck,&rsquo; says the boss,
an&rsquo;, seein&rsquo; as you&rsquo;se a friend of mine, I didn&rsquo;t agree
with any sich sentiments, an&rsquo; tole him the same. He
kind o&rsquo; curled up then; but this mornin&rsquo; he gev me the
perlite push,&mdash;said as he was quittin&rsquo; Bison fer a spell,
an&rsquo; the ranch would be shut down. Anyways, Derry,
I&rsquo;m mighty glad ter see you hoppin&rsquo; aroun&rsquo;. Git down
outer that rig, an&rsquo; hev a sociable drink.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Power consulted his watch, and seemed to arrive at
some decision on the spur of the moment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t wait now,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be here this
evening?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll be around, and I may table a proposition
that will please you. Jim,&rdquo; this to the driver, &ldquo;beat
it to the depot. I want to make the ten o&rsquo;clock to
Denver, and we have only twenty minutes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>MacGonigal, as usual a silent auditor, gazed after
the cloud of dust raised by horse and buggy, and was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
minded, perhaps, to say something. Whatever may
have been his first intent, he repressed it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s yer pizen, Jake?&rdquo; he inquired, and the
cowboy named it.</p>

<p>Late that night Power returned. He was so tired
that he had practically to be carried to bed; but he
contrived to tell the storekeeper that Jake should remain
in Bison at his (Power&rsquo;s) expense until certain
business conditions had developed. Next day he was
too exhausted to take any exercise; but sat in the
veranda after breakfast, smoking and chatting with the
habitu&eacute;s, whose varied surmises he shared, when a
stranger whizzed through the township in the buggy,
vanished in the direction of the Gulch, and returned
with equal celerity of movement a couple of hours
subsequently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Looks like a lawyer,&rdquo; said some wiseacre. &ldquo;Them
fellers air allus on a hair-trigger when a mortgage
falls in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is Willard&rsquo;s time up?&rdquo; inquired another man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thar was talk about it afore this dry spell kem
an&rsquo; cleared him out. Of course&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The speaker stopped suddenly. He was on the point
of alluding to Nancy&rsquo;s marriage, when he remembered
that Power was present, and, in such circumstances,
it is safe to assume that a gathering of rough western
miners will display more real courtesy and consideration
for the feelings of others than may be forthcoming
in far more pretentious circles.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No need to trip your tongue on my account,&rdquo;
laughed Power, reaching lazily for a glass of milk and
seltzer. &ldquo;You were going to say, I suppose, that when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
Mr. Willard&rsquo;s daughter married a rich man the mortgage
difficulty would disappear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Somethin&rsquo; like that, Derry,&rdquo; was the answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you ever hear the amount of the mortgage?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Five thousand, I was told.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Power laughed again. &ldquo;Five thousand!&rdquo; he cried.
&ldquo;Surely Nancy Willard cost more than that! Why,
Marten gave me that amount as a rake-off on one job
I put through for him this spring.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The words were bitter as gall, though uttered in a
tone of quiet banter. None spoke in reply. Each man
there had seen Power and the girl scampering together
through Bison on their ponies so often that the
two were marked down by good-natured gossip as
&ldquo;made for each other.&rdquo; Sympathy now would be useless
and misplaced; so there was silence for awhile,
until a safer and collectively interesting topic was
broached by MacGonigal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kin anybody here tell me what&rsquo;s going on at the
mill?&rdquo; he asked suddenly.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;mill,&rdquo; as the agency through which many thousands
of tons of low-grade telluride ore were transmuted
weekly into a certain number of ounces of gold
and silver, was the breath of life to Bison. If it stopped,
the greater part of the little town&rsquo;s inhabitants was
aware instantly of bare cupboards and empty pockets.
Work might cease at the mines for varying periods
without causing vital harm to the community; but the
metal pulses of the mill must beat with regularity, or
Bison suffered from a severe form of heart disease.
Consequently, there was no rush to volunteer information;
though some of those present had had their sus<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>picions
that all was not as it should be with the giant
whose clamant voice rang ever in their ears.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some books and things was carted from the office
to Denver a-Wednesday,&rdquo; said the know-all who had
spoken about the mortgage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The storekeeper&rsquo;s tone was ominous, and the other
man grinned uneasily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Guess it&rsquo;s what they call an audit,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thar&rsquo;s been two audits a year fer ten years at
Bison, an&rsquo; the books hev never gone ter Denver afore.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Page has been nosin&rsquo; around, too, like as if he was
takin&rsquo; stock,&rdquo; put in a feeder, whose task it was to
guide and shovel ore into the rolls.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Page oughter know what&rsquo;s in the mill by this time,&rdquo;
said MacGonigal, and indeed, the personage under discussion
being the manager, the statement was almost
excessively accurate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thar was talk in the papers awhile sence about
some new process fer treatin&rsquo; low-grade ores,&rdquo; commented
the feeder, apropos of nothing in particular.
Then he seemed to wake into cheerful activity. &ldquo;But
what&rsquo;s the use o&rsquo; meetin&rsquo; trouble halfways?&rdquo; he cried.
&ldquo;Goldarn it! people said the mines was peterin&rsquo; out
more&rsquo;n a year ago, an&rsquo; we&rsquo;re workin&rsquo; full spell this
yer week.... Who&rsquo;s fer a fizz? I go on at six, an&rsquo;
I hev to eat a line fust.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That evening, before the store filled with the day
men, and Power alone was listening, MacGonigal was
more outspoken.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a notion that the mill is goin&rsquo; ter close down,
Derry,&rdquo; he said glumly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Probably, for a time,&rdquo; said Power.</p>

<p>Such prompt agreement was unexpected; but MacGonigal
passed it without comment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nit&mdash;fer good. They lost the main vein a year
last Christmas, an&rsquo; the treatin&rsquo; of ounce ore has
been a bluff whiles they s&rsquo;arched high an&rsquo; low beyond
the fault. No, Derry, Bison is busted. Me
for Denver tomorrow, an&rsquo; any fellar kin hev this
store at a vallyation, wid a good rake-off, too&mdash;dang
it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Power was smoking placidly, and the gloomy
prophecy of his friend did not appear to disturb him.
He even affected to ignore the sigh with which MacGonigal
turned away after gazing at him with an expression
akin to dismay; for the stout man had the
constitutional dislike of his kind to change, and the
store had yielded a steady income since the inception
of Bison.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, Mac,&rdquo; said Power after a long pause, &ldquo;if
you were to dig deep down into your pants, how much
could you ante up?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eight thousand dollars, ef I kep&rsquo; a grubstake,&rdquo;
came the instant response.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what is the mill worth?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It cost the best part of a hundred an&rsquo; fifty thousand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I asked you what it is worth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What it&rsquo;ll fetch.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can you figure it out?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s on&rsquo;y the movable plant. A lot of money
is sunk in cyanide vats, an&rsquo; rails, an&rsquo; buildin&rsquo;s. Guess,
when you come ter whittle it down ter rolls an&rsquo; engines,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
less the cost of takin&rsquo; &rsquo;em ter pieces an&rsquo; fixin&rsquo; &rsquo;em anywhar,
you&rsquo;d git &rsquo;em fer twenty thousand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And plenty, too, for a mill erected ten years ago
to deal with high-grade ore. You see, Mac, the scientific
treatment of rich ores has developed so rapidly
of late that the Bison mill is practically a back number;
while we know that it cannot compete with the
low-grade extractions now practised in Cripple Creek
and at Leadville. No, you must cut down your estimate.
When you buy that mill, Mac, you shouldn&rsquo;t
spring a cent beyond fifteen thousand, and begin by
offering ten. At best, it would only form a nucleus for
real work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Me&mdash;buy&mdash;the&mdash;mill!&rdquo; MacGonigal permitted
himself to be astounded to the point of stupefaction.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, that is what will happen. But not a word
of this to anyone. Start in and sell the store, by all
means; provided you fix its value on the basis of live
business, likely to improve.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Derry, air you wool-gatherin&rsquo;, or what?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Unless I am greatly mistaken, Mac, you and I will
gather as much wool during the next twelve months
as we are likely to need for the remainder of our lives.
I may be wrong, of course, but you will be perfectly
safe. You will grab the mill at its breaking-up price,
and you should sell the store in any event. All I ask
is that you act strictly according to my instructions.
It is hardly necessary to repeat that you must keep
the proposition to yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>These two knew each other thoroughly; though MacGonigal
was well aware that certain unfathomable characteristics
had developed of late in the once carefree<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
and even-minded youngster for whom he felt an almost
parental tenderness. He made no reply. He
asked no question. He knew that when the time came
Power would speak, but not until the scheme he had
in mind, whatever it might be, was ripe for action.
Indeed, ever since the accident, Power had displayed
some of the attributes which caused men to hate and
fear Marten. He, whose laugh had been the merriest
and human sympathies the most marked among all the
men who had passed in review before the storekeeper&rsquo;s
bulbous eyes, was now apt to lapse into a cold cynicism,
an aloofness of interest, a smiling contempt for the
opinions and wishes of his fellows, which had puzzled
and saddened his one stanch friend. But MacGonigal&rsquo;s
confidence in him had not diminished. Rather was
he aware of a broadening and strengthening of
qualities already remarkable, and he hugged the
belief that, as the image of Nancy Willard faded
into impenetrable mists, Power would come back
to his erstwhile sane and wholesome outlook on
life.</p>

<p>So the stout man did not even trouble to put into
words the assurance that he might be trusted to hold
his tongue as to possible occurrences at Bison. After
a prolonged stare at a glorious sunset which silhouetted
the Rocky Mountains in a rich tint of ultramarine
against a sky of crimson and gold, he executed that
unaided transit of a cigar across his mouth for which
he was noted, and when he spoke it was only to assure
the section of Colorado visible through the door that
he was dog-goned.</p>

<p>Thereafter events moved with the swiftness which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
at times seems to possess the most out-of-the-way places
in America like a fever.</p>

<p>The stranger whose guise suggested a lawyer to the
quidnuncs of Bison was not seen again in the township
during the ensuing fortnight; but affrighting rumor,
which soon became deadly fact, told of the mill
closing down for lack of paying ore. Mr. Page, Marten&rsquo;s
representative, promised the sorrowing people that
work would be found for everyone elsewhere. Though
this guarantee alleviated the crushing effect of the
blow, there was much grieving over the loss of more
or less comfortable homes which had been won from
the wilderness by years of patient effort. Men and
women, even in strenuous America, twine their heartstrings
around stocks and stones, and the threatened
upheaval was grievous to them. It meant the breaking
up of families and friendships, a transference to new
districts and a strange environment, a scattering of
the household gods which might never reassemble in
the old and familiar order. Amid the general unrest
none gave much heed to the news that the Dolores ranch
had found a new owner&mdash;who, by the way, according
to the joyous version of the foreman, One-thumb Jake,
meant to raise horses instead of cattle&mdash;but all Bison
felt its hair lifting in amazement when the <i>Rocky Mountain
News</i> announced that Mr. Hugh Marten had sold
the mill to Mr. Peter MacGonigal for a sum unnamed,
but variously estimated between the ridiculous (though
actual) price of twelve thousand dollars (toward which
one-half was contributed by a mortgage on mill and
ranch) and five times the amount as representing its
cheap acquisition as a going concern.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>

<p>Every practical miner knew that the ore bodies in
the mines were exhausted, and many and quaint were
the opinions privately uttered as to Mac&rsquo;s sanity.
Even the astute Page&mdash;once the deeds were signed
and the money paid&mdash;expressed the hope that the storekeeper
would not rue his bargain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; he said diplomatically, &ldquo;you may find
purchasers for some of the plant; but milling machinery
is a special thing, and you will be lucky if you sell
the stuff soon. I suppose you have a purpose in view
for the buildings?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Guess there&rsquo;s some stuff ter be found in the tailin&rsquo;s,
an&rsquo; a few pockets of ore in the mines,&rdquo; said
MacGonigal.</p>

<p>The manager shook his head. &ldquo;You can take it
from me that when Marten sucks an orange there isn&rsquo;t
much juice left for the next fellow,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You
bought the place with your eyes open, and I still think
you may get your money back, with a small profit;
but I advise you strongly not to lose a day in advertising
the rolls and accessories, while the man who has
taken over the Dolores ranch may buy the buildings.
They will come in useful as barns.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll chew on that proposition,&rdquo; said MacGonigal.</p>

<p>Page thought him slightly cracked; but shook hands
affably, and caught the next train for Denver. He
was completely flabbergasted when an assistant whom
he had deputed to superintend the removal of Bison&rsquo;s
citizens to new spheres of labor informed him that
Messrs. Power and MacGonigal were signing on the
whole of the miners and mill-hands at established rates
of pay, and that operations were to be started forth<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>with
on a new strike in the Gulch. When he had recovered
somewhat from the shock of this announcement
he strolled into the government record offices, and examined
the registry of recent mining claims. There
he found that a location certificate had been obtained
by John Darien Power for 1,500 feet by 300 feet on
a well defined crevice, at least 10 feet deep, situated
in the Gulch, Dolores Ranch, Bison, in the county of
Bison and state of Colorado. Other certificates had
been issued to cover more than a mile of the main
contact, and, to clench the mining right, John Darien
Power figured as the legal owner of the land. In a
word, he was &ldquo;a valid discoverer&rdquo; on his own property.</p>

<p>Page was a shrewd man, and he did not commit the
error of underestimating the ability of the rival who
had engineered this subtle stroke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m buncoed this time, and no mistake,&rdquo; he muttered,
and hurried back to his office, pallid with wrath
and foreboding.</p>

<p>There he met Benson, and told him what had happened.
The private secretary, rather staggered at first,
regained his complacency when he had glanced through
some letters and cablegrams received from their common
chief.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The boss has approved of every move in the game,&rdquo;
he said, with a half-hearted laugh. &ldquo;You see, here he
authorizes us to take even less than MacGonigal paid
for the mill, and, when Willard repaid the loan, he
refused to accept it, but cabled that the money was
a gift from Mrs. Marten. So I don&rsquo;t think he can
hold us responsible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not the responsibility I&rsquo;m kicking at, but the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
smooth way in which I was bested,&rdquo; growled Page.
&ldquo;Now, who&rsquo;d have thought Power had it in him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I would, for one,&rdquo; said Benson.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, you hardly knew him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I met him under exceptional conditions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But how the deuce did he manage to locate that
lost vein&mdash;I suppose that is what he has found?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps it was a gift from the gods.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do wish you&rsquo;d talk sense,&rdquo; said the irritated
manager.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What <i>you</i> would call sense might not pass for
wisdom on Olympus,&rdquo; smiled Benson.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you kindly tell me what you are driving at?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t. But look here, Page&mdash;which of us is going
to write this story to the boss?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are, and don&rsquo;t forget to put in those remarks
of yours. They&rsquo;ll help some.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shouldn&rsquo;t I cable? Marten may want to know of
this new move.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I suppose that is the right thing to do. When
you have coded the message, I&rsquo;ll go through it with you.
There must be no mistake this time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus, within a few hours, Hugh Marten, established
at the Meurice in Paris, received news which certainly
took him aback; for he was a man who seldom brooked
a successful interloper. At first he was annoyed, and
had it in mind to discharge Page by cablegram. There
would be no difficulty in giving &ldquo;Messrs. Power and
MacGonigal&rdquo; a good deal of legal trouble. To begin
with, the lawyers would allege collusion against Page,
and an investigation into the purchase of the ranch
might reveal loopholes for legal stilettos. Indeed, his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
alert brain was canvassing all manner of chicanery possible
through statutes made and enacted when his wife
came in, flushed and breathless.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hugh,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had heaps of fun this afternoon!
Madame de Neuville brought me to the Duchesse
de Brasnes&rsquo; place in that quaint old Faubourg St.
Germain, and the Duchesse took such a fancy to me that
we are invited for a week-end shoot at her castle, one
of the real ch&acirc;teaux on the Loire. You&rsquo;ll come, of
course?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, yes, Nancy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You say yes as though I had asked you to go
to the dentist.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a trifle worried, and that&rsquo;s the fact.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it? Can I help?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Marten hesitated; though only for an instant. His
wife was more adorable than ever since she had discovered
what wonders an illimitable purse could achieve
in the <i>boutiques</i> of the Rue de la Paix; but there was
ever at the back of his mind a suspicion that she looked
on her past life as a thing that was dead, and was
schooling herself to an artificial gaiety in these glittering
surroundings of rank and fashion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The truth is that I am vexed at something which
has happened in Colorado&mdash;at Bison,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have had no ill news of Dad?&rdquo; she cried, in
quick alarm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, he&rsquo;s all right. I told you he had sold the ranch.
Well, the purchaser is that young engineer, Derry
Power.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He watched her closely; but trust any woman to mislead
a man when she knows that her slightest change<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
of expression will be marked and understood. Mrs.
Marten&rsquo;s eyes opened wide, and she had no difficulty in
feigning honest surprise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Derry Power!&rdquo; she almost gasped. &ldquo;What in
the world does he want with the ranch?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It seems that he contrived to find the main vein
which we lost in the Esperanza mine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, is that it?&rdquo; She was indifferent, almost bored.
Her mind was in the valley of the Loire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. That idiot Page was kept in the dark very
neatly; so he sold the mill at a scrap price&mdash;by my
instructions, I admit&mdash;and now Power and MacGonigal
have everything in their own hands.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nancy&rsquo;s eyebrows arched, and she laughed gleefully.
&ldquo;Just fancy Mac blossoming into a mining magnate!&rdquo;
she cried. &ldquo;But why should this affair worry you,
Hugh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>His hard features softened into a smile&mdash;in this
instance, a real smile&mdash;for he was intensely proud of
his pretty wife.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hate to feel that I have got the worst of a deal,&rdquo;
he admitted. &ldquo;But that&rsquo;s all right, Nancy. We won&rsquo;t
quarrel with old friends at Bison. Run away and write
to your duchess while I concoct a cable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And so it came to pass that Page, instead of receiving
a curt dismissal, was told to place no obstacles
in the way of the new venture, but rather to facilitate
it by fixing a reasonable price on land and houses not
covered by the sale of the mill, should they be needed
by Marten&rsquo;s successors at Bison. In fact, by an unexampled
display of good will on the part of his employer,
he was bade to offer these properties to Power<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
at a valuation. That somewhat simple though generous
proposal had a highly important sequel when
Francis Willard, rendered furious by learning how he
had been ousted from the ranch, sought legal aid to
begin a suit against Power. Even his own lawyer counseled
abandonment of the law when the facts were inquired
into. Power&rsquo;s title was indisputable, and Marten&rsquo;s
action in selling the mill, no less than his readiness
to make over other portions of the real estate
if desired, showed that the whole undertaking had been
carried through in an open and businesslike way.</p>

<p>Willard was convinced against his will; but, being
a narrow-minded and selfish man, who had not scrupled
to imperil his daughter&rsquo;s happiness when a wealthy
suitor promised to extricate him from financial troubles,
the passive dislike he harbored against Power now
became an active and vindictive hatred. He believed,
perhaps he had honestly convinced himself of this, that
the young engineer had secured the estate by a trick.
It was not true, of course, because he had jumped at
the chance of a sale when approached by the Denver
lawyer acting for Power. But a soured and rancorous
nature could not wholly stifle the prickings of remorse.
He knew that he had forced his daughter into a loveless
marriage; he could not forget the girl&rsquo;s wan despair
when no answer came from Sacramento to her
letters; he had experienced all the misery of a craven-hearted
thief when he stole the letters Power sent to
Bison until Marten assured him that equally effective
measures at the other end had suppressed Nancy&rsquo;s
correspondence also. Because these things were unforgivable
he could not forgive the man against whom<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
they were planned. Penury and failing health had
driven him to adopt the only sure means by which he
could break off the tacit engagement which opposed
a barrier to his scheming; but the knowledge that he
had sinned was an ever-present torture. A certain order
of mind, crabbed, ungenerous, self-seeking, may
still be plagued by a lively conscience, and Willard&rsquo;s
enmity against Power could be measured only by his
own fiercely repressed sufferings.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Curse the fellow!&rdquo; he said bitterly, when the lawyer
told him that a suit for recovery of the ranch
must be dismissed ignominiously. &ldquo;Curse him! Why
did he cross my path? I am an old man, and I do
not wish to distress my daughter, or I would go now
to Bison and shoot him at sight!&rdquo;</p>

<p>So John Darien Power had made at least one determined
enemy, and it may be taken for granted that,
had he visited the Dolores ranch instead of Denver on
that first day in the open air after his accident, no
money he could command would have made him undisputed
lord of the land and all it contained.</p>

<p>But evil thinking is a weed that thrives in the most
unlikely soil. To all appearance, with Nancy wed and
the foundations of a fortune securely laid, Willard&rsquo;s
animosity could achieve small harm to Power. Yet it
remained vigorous throughout the years, and its roots
spread far, so that when the opportunity came they
entangled Power&rsquo;s feet, and he fell, and was nearly
choked to death by them.</p>

<h2><small>CHAPTER V</small><br />

WHEREIN POWER TRAVELS EAST</h2>


<p>One summer&rsquo;s day at high noon a man rode into
Bison from the direction of the railway, and, judging
by the critical yet interested glances he cast right and
left while his drowsy mustang plodded through the dust,
he seemed to be appraising recent developments keenly.
As the horseman was Francis Willard, and as this was
the first time he had visited Bison since leaving the
ranch, there were many novelties to repay his scrutiny.
The number of houses had been nearly doubled,
the store had swollen proportionately, not to mention
the Bison Hotel, which had sprung into being
on the site of the ramshackle lean-to where once MacGonigal&rsquo;s
patrons had stabled their &ldquo;plugs,&rdquo; and a
roomy omnibus rumbled to and fro in the main street
before and after the departure of every train from the
depot.</p>

<p>These unerring signs of prosperity spoke volumes;
but it was only when the rider drew rein near the
mouth of the Gulch that he was able to note the full
measure of Bison&rsquo;s progress. Deep in a hollow to the
left were two mills instead of one, and the noise of ore-crunching
rolls was quadrupled in volume. Two long
rows of recently erected cyanide vats betokened the increased
output of the mine, and, even while Willard sat
there, gazing moodily at a scene almost strange to his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
vision, an engine snorted by, seemingly hauling a dozen
loaded trucks, but in reality exerting its panting energy
to restrain the heavily freighted cars from taking headlong
charge of the downward passage. Another engine,
heading a similar string of empty wagons, was
evidently on the point of making the ascent; so Willard
jogged an unwilling pony into movement again,
and entered the Gulch.</p>

<p>Beyond the two sets of rails, nothing new caught his
eye here until he had rounded the curve leading to the
watershed. Then he came in sight of the original entrance
to the mine&mdash;a shaft was being sunk nearly
three-quarters of a mile away, but he was not aware
of that at the moment&mdash;and noticed that a stout man,
jauntily arrayed in a white canvas suit and brown boots,
who had a cigar tucked into a corner of his mouth,
had strolled out of a pretentious-looking office building,
and was obviously surprised by the appearance of
a mounted man in that place at that moment.</p>

<p>MacGonigal had, in fact, recognized Willard the instant
he swung into view, because none of the ranchers
rode that way nowadays, a more circuitous but safer
trail having been cut to avoid the rails.</p>

<p>Mac had certainly remarked that he was dog-goned
when he set eyes on Willard, and a similar sentiment
was expressed more emphatically by the visitor; for
there was no love lost between those two, and, in consequence,
their greetings were unusually gracious.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wall, Mr. Willard, ef this don&rsquo;t beat cock-fightin&rsquo;!&rdquo;
cried MacGonigal, when the other halted
at the foot of an inclined way leading to the level
space from which rock had been blasted to provide room<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
for the various structures that cluster near the outlet
of a busy mine. &ldquo;Now, who&rsquo;d ha thought of seein&rsquo; you
hereabouts terday?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Or any other day, Mr. MacGonigal,&rdquo; said Willard,
forcing an agreeable smile. The prefix to MacGonigal&rsquo;s
name was a concession to all that had gone before
during a short half-hour&rsquo;s ride. The ex-storekeeper
was now the nominal head of a gold-producing industry
which ranked high in the state, and the bitterness welling
up in Willard&rsquo;s mind had been quelled momentarily
by sheer astonishment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s as may be,&rdquo; returned Mac affably, rolling
the cigar across his mouth. &ldquo;But, seein&rsquo; as you air
on this section of the map, guess you&rsquo;d better bring that
hoss o&rsquo; yourn into the plaza. A bunch of cars is due
here any minute.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Willard jogged nearer, and dismounted, and a youth
summoned by MacGonigal took charge of the mustang.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hev&rsquo; yer come ter see Power?&rdquo; inquired the stout
one, with just the right amount of friendly curiosity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, no, not exactly. I shall be glad to meet him,
of course. Is he somewhere around?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. He went East two days sence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now, the movements of local financial magnates are
duly chronicled in the Colorado press, and MacGonigal
was sure that Willard had not only read the announcement
of Power&rsquo;s departure, but had timed this visit accordingly.
Still, that was no affair of his. Willard
was here, and might stay a month if he liked, because
he would have to pay for bed and board in the Bison
Hotel, which MacGonigal owned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, that&rsquo;s too bad,&rdquo; said Willard, feigning an in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>difference
he was far from feeling. &ldquo;Still, I have no
real business on hand. I happened to be at a loose
end in Denver, and didn&rsquo;t seem to know anybody in
the Brown Palace Hotel; so I came out here, to take
a peep at the old shanty, so to speak.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll hev&rsquo; located an alteration or two already?&rdquo;
chuckled the other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Every yard of the way was a surprise.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Guess that&rsquo;s so; but what you&rsquo;ve seen is small pertaters
with the circus on the other side of the hill.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;On the ranch! Things can&rsquo;t have changed so
greatly there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You come this-a way, an&rsquo; survey the park.&rdquo;</p>

<p>MacGonigal led the visitor through a check office,
and along a corridor. Throwing open a door, he ushered
him into a well furnished room, with two French
windows opening on to a spacious veranda.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This yer is Derry&rsquo;s den,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;He likes ter
look at the grass growin&rsquo;; but my crib is at the other
side, whar I kin keep tab on the stuff that makes most
other things grow as well. Not that it ain&rsquo;t dead easy
ter know why Derry likes this end of the outfit&mdash;an&rsquo;
nobody livin&rsquo; &rsquo;ll understand that better&rsquo;n yerself, Mr.
Willard, when you&rsquo;ve looked the proposition over fer
ten seconds by the clock.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Willard had never found MacGonigal so loquacious
in former days; but he was too preoccupied by the
tokens of success that met his furtive gaze in every
direction to give much heed to any marked change
in his guide&rsquo;s manner. Moreover, he had scarcely set
foot in the veranda before he yielded to a feeling which,
at first, was one of undiluted amazement. The annual<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
rainfall had been normal since he abandoned ranching;
but Colorado in June is not exactly the home of lush
meadows during the best of years, and he was staring
now at a fertile panorama of green pastures, and thriving
orchards, while the ranch itself was set in the midst
of smooth lawns embosomed in a wealth of shrubs and
ornamental trees. Greatest miracle of all, a tiny stream
of pellucid water was flowing down the Gulch.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t quite grasp this,&rdquo; he muttered thickly, while
his eyes roved almost wildly from the dancing rivulet
to the fair savannah which it had made possible.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A bit of a wonder, ain&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; gurgled MacGonigal
placidly. &ldquo;Jest another piece of luck, that&rsquo;s what it
air. Derry can&rsquo;t go wrong, I keep tellin&rsquo; him. I had
a notion the hull blamed show was busted when we
struck a spring at the end o&rsquo; the fust dip of two hundred
feet; but Derry jest laughed in his quiet way, an&rsquo;
said, &lsquo;There oughter be tears round about any place
called Grief, an&rsquo; now we have Dolores weepin&rsquo;. We&rsquo;ve
tapped a perennial spring, Mac, an&rsquo; it&rsquo;s the very thing
I wanted ter make the ranch a fair copy of Paradise.&rsquo;
There you hev&rsquo; it&mdash;Derry&rsquo;s luck&mdash;a pipe line laid on
by Nature&mdash;an&rsquo; him raisin&rsquo; apples, Mr. Willard, raisin&rsquo;
pippins as big as your fist, on land whar <i>you</i> couldn&rsquo;t
raise a bundle of alfalfa!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Willard had to find something to say, or he would
have choked with spleen. &ldquo;Evidently the inrush of
water did not injure the mine?&rdquo; he blurted out; but, for
the life of him, he could not conceal the envy in his voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did good, really,&rdquo; chortled MacGonigal. &ldquo;We had
to drive a new adit, an&rsquo; that cleared away enough rock
ter give us elbow-room. The fust intake was up thar,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>&rdquo;
and he pointed to that part of the Gulch where Power
had once wrought with death on a long-vanished ledge.
&ldquo;Now we go in about a hundred feet west of this yer
veranda, an&rsquo; the haulin&rsquo; is easier.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Power and you have created a marvelous property
here,&rdquo; said Willard after a long pause.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not me,&rdquo; said MacGonigal quickly. &ldquo;I helped
Derry with my wad; but he did all the thinkin&rsquo;, an&rsquo; it&rsquo;s
like a fresh chapter outer a fairy tale when I wake up
every fine mornin&rsquo; an&rsquo; remember that my third share is
bringin&rsquo; me in close on five hundred dollars a day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So Power&rsquo;s interest is worth three hundred thousand
dollars a year?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;More&rsquo;n that, I reckon. The output keeps on pilin&rsquo;
up, an&rsquo; Derry&rsquo;s horses &rsquo;ll add a tidy bit to his bank
balance this year.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;His horses?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yep. Hain&rsquo;t you heerd? One-thumb Jake is manager
of the plug department. Nigh on fifty two-year-olds
&rsquo;ll be sold this fall at two hundred dollars an&rsquo;
more a throw. I suspicioned Derry was goin&rsquo; crazy
when he bought up so many mares; but I allow he has
the bulge on me now. An&rsquo; Jake! Dang me if he didn&rsquo;t
show up at a dance t&rsquo;other evenin&rsquo; with a silver fringe
on his chaps!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Willard turned reluctantly into the darkened room,
and, by some mischance, when his eyes had recovered
from the external glare, the first object they dwelt on
was a framed pencil sketch of the Dolores homestead
as he had last seen it&mdash;a dreary, ramshackle place, arid
and poverty-stricken. In the corner was written,
&ldquo;Nancy,&rdquo; and a date.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;The ways of fortune are mysterious,&rdquo; he said, making
shift to utter the words calmly. &ldquo;I endured ten
long years of financial loss in the house which my daughter
has shown there. She used to know Mr. Power, and
gave the drawing to him, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Derry thinks a heap of that picter,&rdquo; commented
MacGonigal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He never tole me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Willard laughed disagreeably. He had not forgotten
Mac&rsquo;s peculiarities, one of which used to be blank
ignorance concerning any subject on which he did not
wish to be drawn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By the way,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;why did you give the new
mine such a queer name&mdash;El Pre&ccedil;o&mdash;I guess you
know it means, &lsquo;The Price&rsquo;? Why was it called
that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was jest a notion of Derry&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rather odd, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Derry&rsquo;s mostly odd, size him up anyways you
hev&rsquo; a mind ter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I could have understood it better had he christened
the place, &lsquo;The Bargain.&rsquo; He shook me up good
and hard when he grabbed Dolores for five thousand
dollars.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He sure had his wits about him, had Derry,&rdquo; said
MacGonigal admiringly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And he has gone now to New York, you tell me,&rdquo;
went on Willard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;East, I said.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, East stands for New York all the time. Is
he making a long stay there?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He never said a word. Jest, &lsquo;So long, Mack,&rsquo; an&rsquo;,
&lsquo;So long, Derry.&rsquo; That&rsquo;s all thar was to it. Kin I
get you a drink? Thar&rsquo;s a chunk of ice somewhar in
the outfit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, thanks. Time I got a move on. How about
those freight cars of yours? Have I a clear road back
through the Gulch?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thar&rsquo;s a half-hour&rsquo;s off spell right now,&rdquo; was
the prompt answer, and a minute later the resident
manager of El Pre&ccedil;o mine was watching Willard descend
the canyon in the direction of Bison.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d give a ten-spot ter know jest why that skunk
kem nosin&rsquo; round here,&rdquo; he mused, gazing contemplatively
after the slow-moving mustang and its rider.
Then he called the youth who had held the horse during
Willard&rsquo;s brief visit.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What sort of an Indian air you, Billy?&rdquo; he grinned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Purty spry, Boss, when the trail&rsquo;s fresh,&rdquo; said the
boy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, hike after old man Willard, an&rsquo; let me know
when he&rsquo;s safe off this yer section.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Within a couple of hours Billy reported that Willard
had entered a train bound for Denver, and MacGonigal
blew a big breath of relief. It was not that he
had the slightest misgiving as to the effect of Willard&rsquo;s
ill will against either his partner or himself, but he
was intensely anxious that Power should not come in
contact with anyone who would remind him of the
existence of Mrs. Hugh Marten. Power himself never
mentioned her; so his faithful friend and trusted associate
in business could only hope that the passing years,
with their multiplicity of fresh interests, were gradu<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>ally
dimming the memory of events which had altered
the whole course of his life.</p>

<p>MacGonigal did not think it necessary to tell Willard
that Power had brought his mother from San
Francisco soon after the mine proved its worth. Mother
and son occupied the Dolores ranch. The presence of
the gentle, white-haired woman was a positive blessing
to Bison; for she contrived to divert no mean percentage
of her son&rsquo;s big income into channels of social
and philanthropic effort in which she took a close personal
interest. A library and reading-room had been
established; a technical instruction class offered an excellent
supplement to the state school; a swimming
bath was built close to the mills; two churches were
in course of erection; a wideawake theatrical manager
at Denver had secured a site for a theater and the
township already boasted its ten miles of metaled roadway.
In the self-satisfied phrase of the inhabitants,
Bison was becoming &ldquo;quite a place,&rdquo; and everyone
testified that it was to Mrs. Power rather than her
son that all these civic improvements were due. Men
had even ceased to consult Power himself on such
matters.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You run and see my mother about that,&rdquo; he would
say, with a quiet smile, when someone had endeavored
to arouse his sympathy in behalf of a deserving object.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my affair to make the money which she spends.
Get her to O. K. your scheme, and it goes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In business he was equally unapproachable.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Put it before MacGonigal,&rdquo; was his regular
formula. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t do a thing without his say-so. But
I warn you he is a terror. If there&rsquo;s a kink in your<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
proposition, he&rsquo;ll find it, as sure as Jake can run his
fingers onto a splint.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For all that, the stout manager of mine and mill
realized his limitations.</p>

<p>Once, and once only, did MacGonigal act in the belief
that Power had referred a point to him for final
settlement. A glib agent for mining machinery persuaded
him to purchase a new type of drill, which
proved absolutely useless when asked to disintegrate the
hard granite of Colorado. Power laughed when he
heard of its failure.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must have thought it was meant for cutting
cheese, Mac,&rdquo; he said lightly. But the barbed shaft
struck home, and &ldquo;the terror&rdquo; bought no more drills
without first consulting the man who understood them.</p>

<p>Thus, slowly but effectually, Power contrived to isolate
himself from Bison. With an almost uncanny
prescience he gave occasional directions in the mine,
or suggested some modification in the milling process
which invariably resulted in a higher percentage of
extraction. For the rest, he devoted his days to the
improvement of the stud farm, and his evenings to books.
His mother tried vainly to dissipate this recluse trend
of thought and habit. On one memorable occasion she
invited a friend and her two cheerful and good-looking
daughters to visit the ranch for a week. Timidly
enough, she had sprung a surprise on her son, warning
him of the forthcoming invasion only when it was too
late to stop travelers already en route from San Francisco.
Then she, like MacGonigal, had to learn her
lesson. Derry agreed she had acted quite rightly. He
merely expressed a suave doubt that the ladies would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
enjoy the enforced seclusion of a place like Dolores,
but they might appreciate the air. Then he strolled
out, and a telegram from Denver apologized for a sudden
departure to Chicago. He explained in a letter
that he was in need of a number of books, and thought
it best to look through the bookstores in person rather
than trust to catalogues. He returned two days after
the guests had left, and there were no more experiments
in that direction. Be sure that an anxious mother
had long ago formed a remarkably accurate opinion
as to the circumstances attending Nancy Willard&rsquo;s
wedding; but, being a wise woman, she said no word
to her son concerning it, and was content to pray that
the cloud might lift from off his soul, and that he might
yet meet a girl who would make him a good and loving
wife. For that is the way of women who are mothers&mdash;they
find real joy only in the well-being of their offspring.
Though this gentle-hearted creature knew that
she was risking some of her own belated happiness in
bringing about her son&rsquo;s marriage, she was ready to
dare that, and more, for his sake. She longed to renew
her own youth in fondling his children. She was almost
feverishly desirous of seeing him thoroughly established
in a bright and cheerful home before the gathering mists
shut him out forever from her sight. So she waited,
and watched, and wondered what the future had in store
for her loved one, and often, in her musings, she tried
to imagine what manner of girl Nancy Willard was
that she should have inspired such an enduring and
hopeless passion.</p>

<p>The upheaval, when it came, was due to the simplest
of causes. Power had foreseen the tremendous<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
industrial development which lay before Colorado, and
indulged his horse-breeding hobby on lines calculated
to produce a large income wholly apart from the ever-increasing
profits of the mine. The state needed horses,
which must be strong of bone, with plenty of lung capacity;
yet not too heavy, for mountain tracks and
dusty valleys are anathema to the soft Belgian. They
must be presentable animals, too, symmetrical, of untarnished
lineage, and of a type fitted either for saddle
or harness, because Colorado was making money in a
hurry. Thus, it chanced that, shortly before Willard&rsquo;s
ill-omened visit to Bison, an Eastern agent wrote advising
Power to attend a sale in New York. A noted
breeder of hackneys, who had imported some of the
best sires from England and Russia, and owned several
fine Percherons, was breaking up his stud, and
the chance thus presented of securing some magnificent
stock might not be repeated during another decade.</p>

<p>Power asked his mother to accompany him; but she
was afraid of the long journey in the torrid temperature
then obtaining. Yielding to his wishes, she telegraphed
a second time to her San Francisco friends,
and they accepted an invitation joyously and promptly.
Moreover, seeing that she was regarding with some
misgivings his prospective absence from the ranch for
a period which could not well be less than three weeks,
he made a great concession.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If Mrs. Moore and her girls can arrange to stay
so long, keep them here until I return,&rdquo; he said, and
the pleasure in the worn, lined face fully repaid the
effort those words cost him. So they kissed, and parted,
and the weary years which have passed since that sun<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>lit
morning in Colorado have contained no diviner solace
for the man than the knowledge that he left his mother
well satisfied with her lot, and smiling a farewell without
the slightest premonition of evil or sorrow. It is
well to part thus from those whom we love; for no man
knows what the future may have in store&mdash;and horror
would have been added to the burden of Power&rsquo;s suffering
if recollections of the last hours of companionship
with his mother were clouded by an abiding sense
of unkindness or unfilial treatment.</p>

<p>So Power hied him to New York, which meant that
he passed three hot nights and two hotter days in a
fast-speeding train. The Rock Island Railroad took
him across the rolling prairie to Omaha and Chicago,
and, in the city which no steer nor sheep nor hog can
visit and live, he entered the palatial Pennsylvania
Limited, which, in those unregenerate days, dumped
him out early in the morning on the New Jersey shore.
Then, for the first time, he saw New York, and saw it
from the river, which is the one way to see New York
for the first time. Crossing by the ferry to 23d Street,
he did not, it is true, secure that wondrous initial
glimpse of a city, unequaled, in many respects, by any
other, which is vouchsafed to the traveler arriving by
sea. But, even twenty-two years ago, the busy Hudson
was no mean stream, and when Power&rsquo;s unaccustomed
eye turned bewildered from the maze of shipping
which thronged that magnificent waterway it found
fresh wonders in the far-flung panorama stretching
from Grant&rsquo;s Tomb to the Battery. At that time
Trinity Church was still a landmark, for New York
had hardly begun to climb into the empyrean; so the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
prospect was pleasing rather than stupefying, as it is
today.</p>

<p>A hot wind already hissed with furnace-breath over
the fourteen miles of serried streets that lined the opposite
shore; for, in the long years which have sped since
Power first crossed the Hudson, New York has neither
lengthened nor broadened. Even mighty Gotham cannot
achieve the impossible; so, in the interim, several
new cities have been superimposed on the older one
which spread its beauties before his bewildered vision.
The <i>Paris</i>&mdash;who of the middle generation does not remember
the <i>Paris</i>, with her invariable list to starboard,
after an ocean crossing?&mdash;was creeping slowly upstream,
and Power was amused by the discovery that the big
ship, like himself, moved with a limp. The <i>City of Rome</i>,
whose yacht-like lines suggested the poetry of motion,
but, as is the mode on Parnassus, adhered strictly to
suggestion, lay at anchor near the Jersey shore, and
when the ferry churned around her graceful stem, the
grim walls of the Palisades completed a picture which
admits of few peers. Disillusionment came later; but
the spell of that thrilling first impression was never
wholly lost. Driving through 23d Street, on his way
to the Waldorf Hotel, Power could not help comparing
this important thoroughfare with Market Street,
San Francisco, and State Street, Chicago, and the
architectural stock of the metropolis experienced a sudden
slump. Nor did it wholly recover lost points when
his carriage entered Madison Square, with its newly
erected campanile, almost a replica of the stately
Giralda tower in Seville, its glimpses of Broadway,
south and north, its stolid Fifth Avenue Hotel, and its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
chastely elegant, though still towerless, white Metropolitan
building. Even the Waldorf, then less than
a fourth of the Waldorf-Astoria, though notable already
among the public palaces of the world, failed
to strike his imagination with the appeal of the Palace
Hotel, San Francisco; the truth being that New York,
first in the field by a couple of centuries, had not yet
begun, like Milton&rsquo;s eagle, to mew her mighty youth.</p>

<p>It would assuredly be interesting to those who knew
and loved the queen city of the Atlantic nearly a quarter
of a century ago if Power&rsquo;s revised and corrected
opinions might be quoted now. But the chronicle of
a man&rsquo;s life ought to be accurate before it is picturesque,
and the truth is that the heat-wave which was then
withering the whole Eastern seaboard kept this visitor
from breezy Colorado pent within the marble halls of
the Waldorf Hotel, save when urgent need drove him
forth. That particular scourge of high temperature
was destined to become historical. The thermometer
soared up beyond 100 degrees Fahrenheit; hundreds
of people were stricken daily by heat apoplexy; the
hospitals were crammed to their utmost capacity; the
asphalt pavement, where it existed, showed ruts like
a muddy road in the country; and it is easy to understand
why a man who had cheerfully endured 110
degrees and 115 degrees in the dry heat of the nearer
Rockies should gasp for air here like a fish out of water.</p>

<p>Worst of all, the horse sale was postponed. The
owner of the stud and his prospective patrons alike
had flown to sea and mountain for relief. As inquiry
showed that the horse-breeder himself had gone to Newport,
Power made haste to secure a stateroom on one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
of the Fall River line of steamboats, and it was on this
quest that the <i>Puritan Maiden</i>, a vessel on which folk
would travel merely for the sake of describing her to
their friends, brought him to the chief summer resort
of fashionable life in America.</p>

<p>He had not the slightest notion that Mrs. Hugh Marten
was disporting herself daily on that particular
stretch of Rhode Island beach. For all that he knew,
she might as well have been at Trouville or Brighton.
Indeed, had anyone dared the lightning of his glance by
mentioning her, and if he were compelled to hazard a
guess as to her possible whereabouts, he would certainly
have said that, to the best of his belief, she was in
Europe. Such was the fact; but there are facts in every
life which assume the guise of sheer incredibility when
analyzed, say, in the doubtful atmosphere of a law-court.
In the dark days to come, during those silent watches of
the night when a man looks back along the tortuous ways
of the past, John Darien Power could only lift impotent
hands to Heaven and plead in anguish that he might at
least have been spared an ordeal which he not only did
not seek, but would have fled to the uttermost parts of
the earth to have avoided. Such moments of introspection
were few and far between, it is true. His was
too self-contained a nature that he should rail against
the Omnipotent for having tested him beyond endurance.
He made a great fight, and he failed, and he
paid an indemnity which is not to be measured by any
other scale than that alone which records the noblest
effort.</p>

<p>To his own thinking, the tragedy of his life began
that day in Bison when the sympathetic storekeeper told<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
him of Nancy Willard&rsquo;s marriage. But he was wrong
in that belief. A man may lose the woman he loves,
and recover from the blow, but he peers into abysmal
depths when he meets her as another man&rsquo;s wife, and
finds that love, though sorely wounded, is not dead. It
is then that certain major fiends, unknown to the generality,
come forth from their lairs&mdash;and there must
have been a rare awakening of crafty ghouls on the
day Power reached Newport.</p>

<h2><small>CHAPTER VI</small><br />

THE MEETING</h2>


<p>When Power arrived at New England&rsquo;s chief summer
resort on a glorious July morning twenty-two years
ago, man had succeeded in adding only a garish fringe
to a quietly beautiful robe devised by Nature. Some
few pretentious houses had been built; but local residences
in the mass made up an architectural hotch-potch
utterly at variance with sylvan solitudes and
breezy cliffs. Rhode Island, which lends its name to
the entire state, is slightly larger than Manhattan. A
long southwesterly spur shields from the mighty rages
of the Atlantic the little bay on which the old town
of Newport stands; but the climate has the bracing
freshness which is almost invariably associated with the
northern half of that great ocean. If the bare rudiments
of artistry existed among the idle rich who overran the
island during the &rsquo;80&rsquo;s, it should have protected a
charming blend of seashore and grassy downs from the
Italian palaces, Rhenish castles, Swiss chalets, and don-jon
keeps which the freakish conceits of plutocrats placed
cheek by jowl along the coast. Nowadays these excrescences
are either swallowed in forests of well grown
trees or have become so beautified by creepers that they
have lost much of their bizarre effect; while magnificent
avenues, carefully laid out and well shaded, run through
a new city of delightful villas and resplendent gar<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>dens.
But Power&rsquo;s first stroll from the portals of the
Ocean House revealed a medley in which bad taste ran
riot. The Casino, a miserable-looking structure, was
saved from dismal mediocrity by its splendid lawns
alone; the surf-bathers&rsquo; friends were protected from
the fierce sun by a long, low shanty built of rough
planks; the roads were unkempt, and ankle-deep in mud
or dust; broken-down shacks alternated with mansions;
a white marble replica of some old Florentine house,
stuck bleakly on one knob of a promontory, was scowled
at by a heavy-jowled fortress cumbering its neighbor.</p>

<p>He found these things irritating. They were less
in harmony with their environment than the corrugated
iron roofs of Bison. His gorge rose at them.
They satisfied no esthetic sense. In a word, he resolved
to get through his business with the horse-fancying
judge as speedily as might be, and escape to
the unspoiled wilderness of Maine.</p>

<p>Were it not for one of those minor accidents which
at times can exert such irresistible influence on the
course of future events, he would certainly have left
Newport without ever being aware of Mrs. Marten&rsquo;s
presence there. He ascertained that the judge had
gone off early in the morning on a yachting excursion
up Narragansett Bay, having arranged to lunch at a
friend&rsquo;s house at Pawtucket; so, perforce, he had to
wait in Newport another day.</p>

<p>At dinner he was allotted a seat at a large round
table reserved for unattached males like himself. The
company was a curiously mixed one, but pleasant withal.
A Norwegian from San Francisco, who sold Japanese
curios, a globe-trotting Briton, a Southerner from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
Alabama, a man from Plainville, New Jersey, and a
Mexican who spoke no English, made up, with Power
himself, a genuinely cosmopolitan board, and Power
soon discovered that he was the only person present
who could understand the Mexican. Mere politeness
insisted that he should lend his aid as interpreter when
a negro waiter asked the olive-skinned se&ntilde;or what he
would like to eat; but the &ldquo;Greaser,&rdquo; as he was dubbed
instantly, proved to be a jovial soul, who laughed when
any of the other men laughed, insisted on having the
joke translated, and roared again when it was explained
to him, so that each quip earned a double recognition,
while he never failed to pay his own score by some
joyous anecdote or amusing repartee. Thus, Power
was forced into the role of &ldquo;good fellow&rdquo; in a way
which he would not have believed possible a few hours
earlier. In spite of himself, the merry mood of other
years came uppermost, and, when the party broke up
at midnight, after a long and lively sitting on a moonlit
veranda, he retired to his room with a certain feeling
of marvel and agreeable surprise at the change
which one evening of enforced relaxation had effected
in his outlook on life. He decided that these chance
companions had done him a world of good, that his
misanthropic attitude was a false one, and that a week
or two at Newport might send him back to Colorado
a better man. Applying to a state of mind a metaphor
drawn from material things, he felt as an Englishman
feels who leaves his own dripping and fog-bound island
on a January afternoon and wakes next morning amid
the roses and sunshine of the Riviera. The glitter on
land and sea may bear a close resemblance to spangles<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
and gilt paper on the stage; but it is cheering to eyes
which have not seen the sun for weeks, and when, in
such conditions, John Bull sits down to luncheon under
the awnings of a caf&eacute; facing the blue Mediterranean,
he is unquestionably quite a different being from the
muffled-up person who hurried on board the steamer
at Dover.</p>

<p>Power had contrived to withdraw himself so completely
from the more genial side of existence at Bison
that he rediscovered it with a fresh zest. Next day
he was no longer alone. The man from Birmingham,
Alabama, and the Englishman shared his love of horses,
and the three visited the judge, who stabled some of
his cattle on the island, and had photographs and
pedigrees galore wherewith to describe the stock on
his New York farm.</p>

<p>So Power stayed two days, and yet a third, and he
was laughing with the rest at some quaint bit of Spanish
humor which he had translated for the benefit
of the company at dinner on the third evening, when
he became aware that a lady, entering with a large
party, for whose use a table had been specially decorated,
was standing stock-still and looking at him. He
lifted his eyes, and met the astonished gaze of Mrs.
Marten.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Derry!&rdquo; she gasped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nancy!&rdquo; said he, wholly off his guard, and flushing
violently in an absurd consciousness of having committed
some fault. She had caught him, as it were,
in a boisterous moment utterly at variance with the
three years of self-imposed monasticism which followed
her marriage. Yet, with the speed of thought, he saw<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
the futility of such reasoning. The girl-wife knew
nothing of his sufferings. She was greeting him with
all the warmth of undiminished friendship, and could
not possibly understand that he had endured tortures
for her sake. So he regained his wits almost at once,
and was on his feet, bowing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon, Mrs. Marten,&rdquo; he went on.
&ldquo;Your presence here took me completely unawares.
You are the last person breathing I expected to see
in Newport.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She laughed delightedly, with no hint of flurry or
confusion beyond that first natural outburst.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would sound much nicer if you said what I
am going to say to you,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;that you are
one of the few persons breathing whom I am really
delighted to see in Newport. But I can&rsquo;t stop and
talk now. I&rsquo;ll ask Mrs. Van Ralten to forgive me if
I slip away from her party for ten minutes after dinner.
Mind, you wait for me on the veranda. I&rsquo;m simply
dying to hear some news of dear old Bison! How
is Mac? Oh, my! I really must go. But don&rsquo;t you
dare escape afterward!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Forgetful of all else, he allowed his startled eyes
to follow her as she ran to her place at the neighboring
table. She was dressed in some confection of
white tulle and silver; a circlet of diamonds sparkled
in her thick brown hair; a big ruby formed a clasp in
front for an aigrette of osprey plumes; her robes and
bearing were those of a princess. Were it not for
the warranty of his senses, he would never have pictured
the girl of the Dolores ranch in this fine lady.
Even now he stood as one in a trance, half incredulous<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
of the evidence of eyes and ears, and seemingly afraid
lest he might awake and come back to the commonplaces
of an existence in which the Nancy Willard of
his dreams had no part.</p>

<p>The Englishman, Dacre by name, knew something
of the world and its denizens, and he had seen the
blood rush to his friend&rsquo;s face and ebb away again
until the brown skin was sallow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sit down, old chap,&rdquo; he said quietly. &ldquo;I was
just thinking of ordering some wine for the public benefit.
Do you drink fizz?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The calm voice helped to restore Power&rsquo;s bemused
senses. Afraid lest his moonstruck attitude might have
been observed by some of Mrs. Marten&rsquo;s companions,
he tried to cover his confusion by a jest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wine, did you say?&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Certainly&mdash;let&rsquo;s
have a magnum. Bottled sunlight should help to dissipate
visions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Anacreon has something to that effect in one of
his odes; though he vowed that he worshiped Wine,
Woman, and the Muses in equal measure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is Anacreon?&rdquo; asked the man from Plainville.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He flourished at Athens about 600 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>,&rdquo; laughed
Dacre.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did he? By gosh! The Greeks knew a bit, then,
even at that time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This one in particular was an authority on those
three topics. Love, to him, was no mischievous boy
armed with silver darts, but a giant who struck with
a smith&rsquo;s hammer. He died like a gentleman, too, being
choked by a grapestone at the age of eighty-five.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, that explains it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Explains what?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He had a small swallow, or rum and romance would
have knocked him out in half the time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Power was rapidly becoming himself again. &ldquo;I
behaved like a stupid boy just now,&rdquo; he said;
&ldquo;but I was never more taken aback in my life.
I have not met Mrs. Marten since her marriage,
three years ago, and I imagined she was in
Europe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, is that Mrs. Marten?&rdquo; chimed in downright
Plainville. &ldquo;Last Sunday&rsquo;s papers whooped her up
as the prize beauty of Newport this summer, and I
guess they got nearer the truth than usual. She&rsquo;s a
sure winner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did I hear her mention Mrs. Van Ralten?&rdquo; inquired
Dacre.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, her hostess tonight, I believe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Van Ralten and Marten hurried off together to the
Caspian last week. They are interested in the oil wells
at Baku.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cymbals seemed to clash in Power&rsquo;s brain, and he
heard his own voice saying in a subdued and colorless
staccato, &ldquo;I am sorry I did not meet her sooner. I
leave tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dacre looked at him curiously; but the wine had
arrived, a choice vintage of the middle &rsquo;70&rsquo;s, and the
Mexican was lifting his glass.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>El sabio muda conseja; el necio no</i>,&rdquo; he quoted.</p>

<p>The phrase was so apt that Power glanced at the
speaker with marked doubt; whereupon the blond Norwegian
asked what the se&ntilde;or had said.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;He told us that the wise man changes his mind,
but the fool does not,&rdquo; translated Power.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gee whizz!&rdquo; cried Plainville. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pity he can&rsquo;t
give out the text in good American; for he talks horse
sense most all the time. If <i>I</i> had a peach like Mrs.
Marten callin&rsquo; me &lsquo;Derry,&rsquo; damn if I&rsquo;d quit for a
month!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The general laugh at this dry comment evoked a
demand by the Mexican for a Spanish version of the
joke. Then he made it clear that he had resolved
to abjure wine, and was only salving his conscience by
a proverb.</p>

<p>This cheerful badinage, which might pass among any
gathering of men when one of them happened to be
greeted by a pretty woman, did not leave Power unscathed.
He had dwelt too long apart from his fellows
not to wince at allusions which would glance harmlessly
off less sensitive skins. The iron which had entered
into his soul was fused to a white heat by sight
of the woman he had loved and lost. He resented what
he imagined as being the knowledge these boon companions
boasted of his parlous state. Unable to join
in their banter, not daring to trust his voice in the
most obvious of retorts, for the man from Plainville
had not been designed by nature to pose as a squire
of dames, he gulped down a glass of champagne at
a draft, and pretended to make up for wasted time
in an interrupted course.</p>

<p>Dacre seemed to think that he would be interested
in the latest gossip in financial circles with reference
to a supposed scheme organized by Marten and Van
Ralten to fight the Oil Trust. Power listened in si<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>lence
until he felt sure of himself; then he launched
out vigorously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It strikes me that America has lost the art of
producing great men,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We whites are degenerating
into mere money-grubbers; so, by the law
of compensation, our next demigod should be a nigger.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; snorted Alabama, eager for battle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s my serious opinion,&rdquo; continued Power dogmatically.
&ldquo;And, what&rsquo;s more, I think I know the nigger.
Have any of you dined in the Auditorium Hotel,
Chicago?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yes, several; dining-room on top floor; lightning elevator;
all right going up empty, but coming down full
was rather a trial.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you will remember that, as you go in, a
young colored gentleman takes your hat and overcoat,
and cane or umbrella. He supplies no numbered
voucher, and cannot possibly tell at which tables some
six or seven hundred diners will be seated. At this
time of year every man is wearing a straw hat of similar
design; yet, as each guest comes forth, he is handed
his own hat and other belongings. Now, I hold that
that nigger has a brain of supreme mathematical excellence.
There is not a financier in Wall Street who
could begin to emulate that feat of memory. Given
a chance, and such men make their own opportunities.
The Auditorium cloakroom attendant will rise to a
dizzy height.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tosh!&rdquo; exclaimed Alabama, primed with facts to
prove that hundreds of negroes could perform similar
tricks, but were no good for anything else.</p>

<p>He was no match for Power in an argument where<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
figures held a place, and Dacre was the only other
man present who realized that the talk had been boldly
and skilfully wrenched to an impersonal topic. He,
at any rate, made no further allusion to Marten or his
projects; though he continued to watch Power narrowly
but unobtrusively. Himself something of a derelict,
though his aimless path lay in summer seas, he had
conceived a warm regard for the quiet-mannered
stranger from Colorado. Neither he nor any of the
others knew aught of Power&rsquo;s history, who might really
be the rancher he professed to be, though his student&rsquo;s
features and reserved manner did not bear out the assumption.
Later, when Dacre was better informed, he
realized the cause of his first skepticism, for the engineer
belonged to one of those rarer types of mankind
who, like the lawyer, the soldier, the physician, and
the clergyman, had the seal of his life&rsquo;s work stamped
plainly upon him.</p>

<p>Hence, it followed that in a spirit of sheer comradeship
and sympathy he kept an eye on Power during
the next few days. He saw how matters were tending,
and risked a rebuff in offering a friendly hint when
disaster was imminent. Above all&mdash;whether for good
or evil who can judge? at any rate, the writer of this
record of a man&rsquo;s life feels least qualified to decide the
point&mdash;he brought a dominating influence to bear at
a moment when Power was adrift in a maelstrom which
threatened to engulf him.</p>

<p>Yet there was slight sign of impending tempest in
that bright room with its groups of diners seemingly
well content with their surroundings. From the adjoining
table, which Power could not see owing to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
position he occupied, came gusts of animated conversation.
Mrs. Van Ralten rejoiced in the loud, penetrating
accents of the Middle West, and snatches of
her talk were audible.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do think James Gordon might have provided a
more stylish Casino while he was about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I sail on the <i>Teutonic</i> first week in August.
Nothing will keep Willie away from the moors on the
Twelfth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did I see them? My dear, who could miss them?
Has anyone ever met such freaks outside a dime
museum?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Nancy, I don&rsquo;t wonder a little bit that you
were such a success in Paris. The nice things I was
told about you turned me green with envy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alabama hotly contested each milestone of the Mason
and Dixon Line; but Dacre believed that Power was
less intent on the color problem than on catching each
syllable of a sweet voice seldom heard above the clatter
of tongues at the next table. At last the meal was
ended, and the men strolled out into the veranda. Mrs.
Marten seemed to know when her friend had risen; she
turned and waved a hand, and obviously explained her
action in the next breath. Soon she appeared, a radiant
being fully in keeping with moonlight and a garden
of exotics.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mary Van Ralten is a duck,&rdquo; she said joyously,
when Power hurried forward. &ldquo;She has given me half
an hour; but I mustn&rsquo;t be a minute later, as she has
turned out of her own house to accommodate the Barnstormers
from Boston, who are acting for her guests
tonight. All Newport will be there. You are coming,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
Derry. I asked her, and will introduce you afterward.
My carriage will wait. But, gracious me, why are you
lame?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was leading her to a couple of reserved chairs
in a palm-shaded nook, and she noticed that he walked
with a limp.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Happened an accident near the mine quite a time
since,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never heard. I wonder my father didn&rsquo;t mention
it. Anyhow, Derry, why have you never written?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Listen to the pot calling the kettle, or, if that
is only a trite simile, listen to the Fairy Queen berating
a poor mortal for her own lapses!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, I have not written since my marriage, it is
true, but you treated my hapless missives so cavalierly
when I did send them that I hardly dared risk another
rebuff.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; he asked thickly. He was
priding himself on the ease with which they were establishing
new relations, when this unlooked-for development
plunged him again into a swift-running current
of doubt and foreboding. They were seated now, not
side by side as he had planned, but in such wise that
Nancy could see his face clearly, she having deliberately
pulled her chair round for that purpose.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Exactly what I have said,&rdquo; she answered composedly.
&ldquo;I sent three separate letters to Mr. John
Darien Power, the Esperanza Placer Mine, Sacramento&mdash;I
sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t forget the address in a hurry, because I&rsquo;ve
always longed to ask why you were so ready to desert
a friend&mdash;and, seeing that not one of them was re<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>turned
by the postoffice, I had good reason to suppose
that they reached you all right. Derry, don&rsquo;t tell
me you never got them!&rdquo;</p>

<p>His heart seemed to miss a beat or two. In an
instant he guessed the truth, that their correspondence
had been burked by malicious contriving; but all he
could find to say was:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you really write to me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course, I did. Am I not telling you? And you,
Derry, did <i>you</i> write to <i>me</i>?&rdquo;</p>

<p>His tongue almost cleaved to the roof of his mouth;
for he knew, in that instant, that they were not seated
in the comfortable veranda of the Ocean House, but
standing side by side on the lip of an abyss.</p>

<p>He must not, he dared not, answer truly. He had
no right to make wreck and ruin of this bright young
life, and none knew so well as he how proudly she would
denounce the thievish wiles which had separated them
if once she grasped their full import.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is so long ago,&rdquo; he muttered brokenly. &ldquo;So
many things have occurred since. I have forgotten.
I&mdash;I can only be sure that I received no letters from
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have forgotten!&rdquo; she repeated slowly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;that is, I suffered a good deal from a broken
leg&mdash;it was badly set&mdash;that is why I have such a
noticeable hobble. Events round about that period are
all jumbled up in my mind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The explanation was lame as his leg. It would never
have deceived even the Nancy Willard of bygone years,
and was utterly thrown away on this wide-eyed woman.
She was conscious of a fierce pain somewhere in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
region of her heart, and wanted to cry aloud in her
distress; but she crushed the impulse with a self-restraint
that had become second nature, and bent nearer,
smiling wanly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why did you throw away your cigar, Derry?&rdquo; she
said. &ldquo;Please smoke. Like every other man, you will
talk more easily then. And do tell me what has been
going on at Bison. I have often asked Hugh for news;
but he says he never hears a word about the place since
he sold his interests there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Power hardly realized how swiftly and certainly she
had made smooth the way. He was conscious only of
a vast relief that the subject of the missing correspondence
was dropped. Only in later hours of quiet
reflection did he grasp the reason&mdash;that she was bitterly
aware of the truth, and the whole truth. He began
at once to describe developments on the ranch, and was
too wishful to hide his own confusion behind the smoke of
a cigar to notice how a white-gloved hand clenched the
arm of a chair when he spoke of his mother and the
place she filled in public esteem. Unconsciously he was
telling Nancy just what she wanted to know. He was
not married. There was no other woman! She uttered
no sound; but her lower lip bore a series of white
marks for a little while.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; he explained glibly, &ldquo;I acquired the habit
of letting other people work when I was laid by for
repairs. Please excuse these frequent references to
a broken limb, which seems to figure in my talk much
as King Charles&rsquo;s head in Mr. Dick&rsquo;s disjointed manuscripts.
Anyhow, I had plenty of time for reading, as
the mine paid from the very beginning, and a rock<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
spring which nearly scared Mac stiff came in handy to
irrigate the upper part of the ranch&mdash;that long slope
just below the Gulch, you remember.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I remember,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, what between fruit-growing and horse-breeding,
I hardly ever have time to go near Bison. My
mother drives in every day over the new trail&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What new trail?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We had to cut a road across the divide. The
Gulch is blocked by rails.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is where the mine is, you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. Whereabouts exactly is the
mine?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It starts in the west side of the canyon, about a
hundred yards from the ranch end.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Near a narrow cleft, topped by a sloping ledge?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. How well you recollect every yard of the
ground!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How did you come to locate the lost seam there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By sheer chance. Some pieces of the granite wall
fell away, and any miner who had been a week at his
trade would have recognized the vein then.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When did they fall away&mdash;the bits of rock,
I mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It must have been about the time you&mdash;you were
married, Mrs. Marten.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She tapped a satin-shod foot emphatically on the
boarded floor. &ldquo;Why are you calling me &lsquo;Mrs. Marten&rsquo;?&rdquo;
she demanded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do it again. I am &lsquo;Nancy&rsquo; to you, Derry.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
I refuse to part with the privileges of friendship in
that casual way. But I want to understand things
more closely. What caused the stones to fall?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind telling,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;though a good
many people have asked me the history of El Pre&ccedil;o, and
I have refused hitherto to gratify their curiosity&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;El Pre&ccedil;o&mdash;doesn&rsquo;t that mean &lsquo;the price&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What an extraordinary name! The price of
what?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of my broken leg. There, you see! King Charles&rsquo;s
head once more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She paused, ever so briefly, before resuming her
questioning. &ldquo;Now, why did the stones fall?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because an excited cowboy fired his revolver in
the air, and the bullets struck a section of rock which
required some such shock to dislodge it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But how did that affect you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I happened to be lying on the very ledge you spoke
of, and&mdash;oh, dash it all! I secured my limp then and
there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did the fall disturb a rattlesnake?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It may have disturbed a dozen rattlesnakes, for all
that I can tell. But what an extraordinary thing to
say! Did you know that a rattler lived in that
cleft?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. I was just thinking of the Gulch and its
inhabitants. Perhaps my wits were wandering....
Come, Derry. Our half-hour is not gone, but we can
talk on the way. Send a boy for my carriage. Do
you want your hat and coat?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She rose suddenly, and drew a light wrap of silvery<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
tissue around her shoulders. Power stood up, and faced
her. He had never seen her looking so ethereally beautiful,
not even on the night, now so long ago, when
he parted from her before taking that disastrous journey
to Sacramento.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you really think I ought to come with you to
Mrs. Van Ralten&rsquo;s?&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course. Why not? You are invited.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are my big brother from Bison, Derry, and
I&rsquo;m not going to forgo the pleasure of your company
if all Newport lined the road and bawled, &lsquo;Send him
away!&rsquo; But do hurry. Mary Van Ralten will forgive
everything except unpunctuality.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The nebulous protest on Power&rsquo;s lips faded into
silence. &ldquo;On such a night I can dispense with hat and
overcoat,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Your carriage is a closed landau,
I suppose?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. After the play you can escort me to the
Breakers&mdash;that is the name of the house we have rented&mdash;and
Sam, our coachman, will take you home....
Oh, there he is, waiting. Mrs. Van Ralten&rsquo;s,
Sam.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said the negro, who had brought a
carriage and pair to the doorway when he caught sight
of his mistress. A negro footman opened the door, and
Nancy entered, the brilliant moonlight gleaming for
an instant on the sheen of a white silk stocking. Power
seated himself by her side, and the horses dashed off.
He felt the soft folds of her dress touching him. When
she turned slightly to say something about the marvelous
nights which tempered the heat-wave at New<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>port,
her right shoulder and elbow pressed him closely.
Some subtle fragrance came from her that stirred him
almost to a frenzy of longing; yet he dared not flinch
away into a corner of the carriage. Perforce, he
schooled his voice to utter the platitudes of the moment.
Yes, he had been in Newport three whole days,
and had not the remotest notion that she was there. He
had come to buy horses, and might remain another
week. Well, he <i>would</i> remain, now that they had met;
for he was sure he would find a good deal to tell her
of Bison and its folk once he had got over the novelty
and unexpectedness of this meeting.</p>

<p>And all the time his heart was pounding madly, throbbing
so furiously that he feared lest she should become
aware of its lack of restraint, and he stooped forward
in a make-believe glance at some building they were
passing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is the Casino,&rdquo; she said, misinterpreting his
action, or pretending to&mdash;Heaven alone knows the extent
of a woman&rsquo;s divination where a man is concerned!
&ldquo;We play tennis there, in the evenings, when it&rsquo;s
so hot during the day. Are you a tennis-player,
Derry?... Oh, I&rsquo;m sorry! I quite forgot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have been arousing your sympathy by false pretense,&rdquo;
he said, and the laughter in his voice demanded
a real effort. &ldquo;I can walk and ride and jump and
dance as well as ever, and I have taught three of the
ranchmen to play tennis quite creditably. So, if
the Newport stores run to flannels and rubber
shoes&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Derry,&rdquo; she cooed, &ldquo;you are not such a fraudulent
person as you imagine. If you knew how much<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
you have told me tonight about yourself, you would
be awfully surprised, as they say in London. But here
we are at Mrs. Van Ralten&rsquo;s. Now, be nice to everybody;
for I mean you to have a real good time in Newport.
People here can be very pleasant acquaintances
if you take them the right way.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><small>CHAPTER VII</small><br />

THE FORTY STEPS</h2>


<p>During the next few days Power passed imperceptibly
through many phases of thought and emotion.
When his judgment regained its natural equipoise after
the first bitter-sweet intoxication of finding his old
sweetheart desirous as ever of his companionship, he
appeared to subside into a state of placid acceptance
of such restricted blessings as the gods could offer.
Nancy made good her promise, and Newport society
threw wide its doors to the good-looking and well-mannered
visitor. No doubts were raised concerning
his financial or social status. A word from the horse-fancying
judge made it clear that the Westerner could
not be a poor man, seeing that he had already bought
at stiff prices a magnificent hunter and the best-matched
pair of hackneys in the States, and was in treaty for another
round dozen of valuable animals; while Mrs. Hugh
Marten&rsquo;s manifest approval was sufficient to introduce
any similarly favored young man to the most exclusive
circle in the island.</p>

<p>Seeing that certain things were essential, Power spent
money freely, supplying himself with a dog-cart, a
groom, a valet, and the rest of the equipment which
any man needed who would mix in that fashionable
crowd without attracting attention by lack of it. Each
morning he and Nancy, sometimes unaccompanied, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
more often mingling with a lively party, rode about
the island, following rough tracks which are smooth
roads nowadays, and visiting every favorite stretch
of cliff and open country time and again. When the
weather moderated its torrid rigor, and sports became
possible in the grounds of the Casino or within the
Polo Club&rsquo;s inclosure, he bore his full share. In all
that pertained to horsemanship he was the equal of any
man in Newport, and Nancy had not lost that perfect
confidence in the saddle which life on a ranch demands.
Someone gave prizes for a drag hunt, a hunting crop
for the first man and a silver cup for the first woman
in at the finish of a ten-miles&rsquo; trail, and the two came
in side by side, a furlong ahead of their closest follower.
Luncheons, yachting parties, dinners, musicales,
and dances crowded each day and often went far
into the night. The heat-wave had put forward the
almanac, and the Newport season was in full swing
nearly a month in advance of its usual date.</p>

<p>Power retained his rooms at the Ocean House; but
saw little of other inmates of the hotel unless they
happened to mix in the same set. His friends of the
dinner-table, except Dacre, had gone, and the Englishman,
like Power, was made an honorary member of the
Casino Club; so they kept up and developed an acquaintance
which had begun so pleasantly.</p>

<p>The close intimacy between Mrs. Marten and the
stranger from Colorado attracted slight comment. No
breath of scandal fluttered the dovecotes of Newport.
The behavior of the pair was exemplary, and, beyond
the accepted fact that, if any hostess desired the presence
of one she must invite the other, gossip about them<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
was noticeable by its absence. Their mutual use of
Christian names from the outset established a tacit
cousinship, and the only growl uttered behind their
backs was an occasional complaint from some anxious
mother who found her attractive daughters completely
eclipsed, in the eyes of at least one eligible young man,
by the millionaire&rsquo;s wife.</p>

<p>Once, and once only, before the crash came, did
Nancy allude to the purloined letters. She and Power
were riding along the Cliff Walk before breakfast, when
she broached the subject quite unexpectedly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Derry, I want to ask you something,&rdquo; she said
seriously. &ldquo;Did my father and you ever quarrel without
my knowledge&mdash;before I left Bison, I mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be stupid! I hate answers in monosyllables.
When you say no like that, one suspects that it may
really be a kind of yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then let me make it the most definite sort of negative.
Remember, you fixed a period. The last time I
spoke to Mr. Willard before I was&mdash;before I went to
Sacramento&mdash;I had supper at the ranch.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He carried reminiscence no farther. She stole a
look at him; but his eyes were fixed on a faint blur
of smoke rising over the azure plain of the Atlantic
from an invisible steamship. On that unforgetable
night of three and a half years ago, a starlit night of
spring, she had walked with him to the mouth of the
Gulch, and in bidding each other farewell they had
exchanged their first and last kiss.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Father was certainly not an enemy of yours then,&rdquo;
she went on, in a singularly even tone. Indeed, she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
might have been debating a matter of utmost triviality.
&ldquo;It seemed to me that he always welcomed you at the
ranch. Why did he become so bitterly opposed to you
afterward?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He could have fenced with her, but deemed it preferable
to speak freely. &ldquo;I think he was annoyed by my
rapid success,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;He had made a failure of
things generally, and I candidly admit it must have been
exasperating to see a youngster like me, and a steady-going
fossil like Mac, step in and secure a fortune out
of a place where he had met with nothing but ill-luck.
Those who get rich quick often incur animosity in that
way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For a brief space there was silence. They seemed
to be listening to the slumberous plash of the breakers
on the rocks far below, which, with the pleasant
creaking of saddlery, and the hoofbeats and deep
breathing of eager horses held in restraint, were the
only sounds audible in that wondrous solitude. They
were passing a part of the cliff known as the Forty
Steps, a euphonious name describing a series of railed
staircases, cut in the solid rock, which afforded an irregular
if safe passage to the beach. Ochre Point,
with its millionaire residences, lay a mile, or less, in
front, and on their left was the illimitable ocean. After
a bath and breakfast they had promised to join a large
party on a steam yacht bound for Narragansett Pier,
when luncheon and a picnic at a lighthouse would fill
the afternoon. This day was precisely similar to any
other day of a whole fortnight in its round of amusements.
The weather was nearly perfection, and distinctly
unsuited for a heart-searching discussion; but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
Nancy seemed to be in a mood that either invited self-torture
or wished to witness the writhings of her companion,
because she would not leave a difficult subject
alone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Supposing, Derry,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;supposing I
hadn&rsquo;t got married when I did, do you think you would
have discovered the mine just the same?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now he was compelled to go off at a tangent. &ldquo;You
resemble the majority of your sex in your desire to
raise non-existent bogies for the mere pleasure of slaying
them,&rdquo; he began.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Which is the bogy&mdash;my supposition or the mine?&rdquo;
she broke in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How can I imagine what would have happened in
circumstances which did not take place? The discovery,
or rediscovery, of the mine was one of those extraordinary
bits of good luck which Fortune sometimes
thrusts upon her favorites. It might have occurred if
you had never left Bison; but, on the other hand, it
might not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She nodded her complete agreement. By not answering
he had answered fully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, the goddess was certainly kind to you,&rdquo; she
said. &ldquo;The cowboys did not often ride through the
Gulch firing their revolvers. In fact, the only time I
can recall any such riotous proceeding was on the day
of my wedding. That must have been your lucky day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She watched him closely; but his face showed no sign
of emotion. Yet she was sure that his eyes narrowed
somewhat as they continued to search the horizon,
and his lips were set with a dourness hardly warranted
by an enjoyable ride on a carefree morning.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span></p>

<p>Then she smiled, very slightly, as though she was
well pleased. She was not cruel; but any woman who
wants to assure herself that a man loves her will understand
why Nancy Marten was putting Power on the
rack, and even tightening the cords almost beyond
endurance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry if I have worried you, Derry,&rdquo; she said,
with a tender caress in her voice that in no wise helped
to mitigate his suffering. &ldquo;One more question, and
I have done. Have you told your mother that I am
here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was no help for it. He lied boldly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did she say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am expecting her reply any hour.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And Mac? Did you give him my love?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t written to Mac since I came to Newport;
but I shall not omit a word of your message when I
see him, or write, whichever comes first.... Have you
any idea what time it is?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Time these lazy gees were stirring themselves.
Come, Hector!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She shook the reins on her horse&rsquo;s neck, and the big
hunter jumped off in a fast canter. Power raced alongside,
and the two struck into a byroad leading to Bellevue
Avenue. Power was busying his brain to formulate
some colorless phrase which would supply a natural-sounding
comment by his mother on the fact that he
had encountered an old friend in Newport. He knew
well that he dared not tell her; for the tidings would
distress her immeasurably. But he need not have troubled
himself. Nancy never mentioned the matter again,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
for the very convincing reason that she did not believe
him. Her allusion to Mrs. Power was one last turn
of the screw. She was as certain that he could no
more explain her presence to his mother than she could
explain his to her father. Twice had she written his
name in letters to Denver, and twice had she destroyed
the letter. On the night she met Power she had dashed
off a hot and impetuous note asking Willard why
Derry&rsquo;s letters had been withheld; but, in calmer mood,
this dangerous query was given to the flames. On a
second occasion, about a week later, Power&rsquo;s name crept
inadvertently into a description of some incident at
the Casino, and the warm blood rushed to her face and
neck when she found how near she was to committing
the letter to the post without having read it.</p>

<p>All that day Power was puzzled by a new serenity
shining in Nancy&rsquo;s eyes. He could not guess that, more
candidly analytical than he, she had looked fearlessly
into the future and had discounted its agonies. She
felt now that she had been tricked into a loveless marriage;
that Marten had purchased her with exactly the
same cold calculation of values which he would have
applied to a business undertaking. Willard had proved
as potter&rsquo;s clay in his hands, and every turn and twist
of the project was clear to her vision as though her
husband, yielding to sardonic impulse, had set forth the
unsavory story in black and white. But it was one
thing to recognize how she had been duped, and another
to strike out boldly for instant freedom. And
in that respect the woman was braver than the man.
Power was content to live in the golden present, to
stifle the longings and plaints of silent hours; while<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
the woman who loved him thought only of the end she
now held firmly in view and recked little of the means
whereby that end might be achieved.</p>

<p>Their unhappy plight was intensified by the fact that
their characters had deepened and broadened alike during
the years of separation. The boy and girl attachment
of those heedless days in Colorado might not have
withstood the strain of being thrown together again
constantly after so long an interval, if the woman&rsquo;s nature
had not advanced step by step with the man&rsquo;s. Experience
of life, and the educative influences of foreign
travel and good society, had done for Nancy what quiet
study and seclusion from his fellow-men had done for
Power. By such widely different paths they had
reached a common standard of earnest purpose and
high resolve, and Nancy, at any rate, was passionately
determined not to sacrifice the remainder of her youth
because of the unhallowed compact which sold her to
gilded misery and robbed her of her one true mate
in all the world.</p>

<p>As she did not blink the consequences, there remained
but to carry through her desperate scheme as speedily
and quietly as was compatible with no risk of failure.
Her one difficulty lay with Power himself. She had
first to break down his sense of honor, a task which
could be accomplished only by making him see clearly
that her life&rsquo;s happiness was at stake. And she knew
him, oh, so well&mdash;far better than he knew himself! Let
Derry once find tears in her eyes, tears which he alone
could dispel, and the seeming fortress of his self-control
would crumble into dust. Let her once twine
her arms around him, and what man-made laws would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
wrench them apart? For, by her reasoning, the solemn
ordinances which govern frail human nature were
wholly on her side. If marriage were, indeed, a divine
institution, its very essence was profaned when Hugh
Marten laid his sorry plan and made it effective by
sheer force of money. She, the woman, would be called
on to pay for her liberty in the coin minted of ill-repute,
that base metal for whose currency her sex was
mainly responsible. But those friends whom she valued
would hear the truth, and they would rally round her,
never fear! Why, in this delightful island, where pain
and anguish seemed to be banished by the imperious
ukase of deities presiding over the revels of the rich, people
recognized as leaders of society had passed already
through a furnace of scandal and scathing exposure
such as she and her lover would never be called upon
to face.</p>

<p>And that was why Power was at once bewildered
and raised to the seventh heaven by her confident, contented
smile when they met among the crowd of merrymakers
on the yacht, or exchanged a few commonplace
words when doing the round of Narragansett
Bay and at dinner that evening in one of Newport&rsquo;s
summer palaces.</p>

<p>As his dog-cart was in waiting, he had no excuse
to escort her home, but, in saying goodnight, she contrived
again to perplex and delight him by a whispered
request.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Derry,&rdquo; she murmured, &ldquo;make no outside engagement
for tomorrow evening. If you are already
booked up, cry off. I want to dine with you in some
quiet place&mdash;I suppose there is some hotel or caf&eacute;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
in Newport where none of our friends go. Find out,
and send me a note, telling me the time and place. I
shall come in a hired carriage, and quietly dressed&mdash;not
in dinner clothes, I mean&mdash;and you must do the
same. I must have a long talk with you, wholly independent
of our servants, you understand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall obey, at any rate,&rdquo; he said, with a smile
that failed to conceal the unbounded surprise in his
eyes. &ldquo;May I put a question?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, not now. Full details later, as people say in
telegrams.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They parted, and he was so plagued by foreboding
that he would have driven past the Ocean House had
not the horse turned in at the gateway of its own
accord. If Nancy&rsquo;s manner during the day had shown
the least trace of worry or annoyance, he would have
attributed her strange request to a desire to take him
into her confidence. It was possible, for instance, that
some busybody had warned her that a too marked preference
for the society of one man among the many
in Newport would probably reach her husband&rsquo;s ears;
but, in that event, her outraged pride could never have
been veiled by such a mask of unsullied cheerfulness.
If any more drastic explanation of the next day&rsquo;s meeting
suggested itself to his troubled mind, he crushed
it resolutely. In his present mood, the slightest hint
of scandal associated with Nancy&rsquo;s winsome personality
due to their friendship was anathema. He would
have endured any loss, fortune, even life itself, to save
her name from besmirchment.</p>

<p>When he alighted from the dog-cart he knew it was
useless to try and sleep; so he lit a cigar, and sat in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
a remote corner of the veranda. Then he began seriously
to analyze her words. They were to meet in
clandestine fashion; not actually in the garments of
disguise, but at a rendezvous so remote from the frequenters
of the Casino as to run small risk of being
identified. She would drive thither in a &ldquo;hired carriage,&rdquo;
and he was to leave his dog-cart and groom
at home. Moreover, she inferred that he would not
see her until the evening, since the locality of this <i>diner
&agrave; deux</i> was to be written; though they had hardly been
separated by longer intervals than a couple of hours
between seven o&rsquo;clock in the morning and nearly midnight
during each day of a fortnight. What did it all
portend? Was this to be their last meeting? At that
thought a fierce pain gripped him, and he was sorely
tempted to call the gods to witness that he would not
return to a lifetime of wandering in the wilderness.
Yet, said a still, small voice within, was it not better
so? She was another man&rsquo;s wife. He must remember
that, remember it even when his pent-up passions
stormed the citadel of his conscience, remember
it when the sheer fragrance of her maddened his senses,
remember it when the taste of Dead Sea fruit was bitterest
in his mouth. Of what worth was he if, for her
dear sake, he was not strong in knightly resolve? And
how could he ever again dare to receive his mother&rsquo;s
kiss if he betrayed the trust which she, at least, reposed
in him?</p>

<p>A mournful and depressing reverie was disturbed by
the arrival of a carriage at the porch. Four young
people alighted&mdash;two honeymoon couples they were supposed
to be&mdash;and their lively voices seemed to ring<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
the knell of his wrecked existence. He listened, only
half hearing, while they chattered like magpies.</p>

<p>They had been to a dance at the Casino, and their
broken comments told of a jolly evening, a capital band,
the best floor that ever was laid, some wonderful dresses,
and an unexcelled supper. Similar young people were
telling each other exactly the same inane commonplaces
all over the eastern part of America at that hour, and
similar cackle would girdle the earth till the crack
of doom. Probably the men were wise as he, and the
women might be deemed by their swains pretty as
Nancy; yet some malign despot among the powers
which control poor humanity had decreed that he alone
should never know these frivolous moments, never be
granted these breathing-spaces of mild abandonment.
And so, wroth with himself, and vexed with the sorry
scheme of things, he went to his rooms.</p>

<p>Next morning, to make sure, he rode to Nancy&rsquo;s
house. No; Mrs. Marten had not ordered her horse;
in fact, she had not appeared as yet, and the pleasant-spoken
butler, showing the requisite confidence in the
discretion of a recognized friend, added that his mistress
would not be &ldquo;at home&rdquo; to anyone before
luncheon.</p>

<p>Then, the weather being glorious and the air like
champagne, Power whistled care to the devil, and cantered
into the town to review the ground for the night&rsquo;s
fixture.</p>

<p>Newport today boasts of almost uncountable hotels
and boarding-houses, nor was the area of choice limited
in that respect nearly a generation ago. After careful
scrutiny of various buildings in the business quar<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>ter,
Power selected a caf&eacute; run by a certain Giovanni
Pestalozzi as the most promising. It looked clean and
bright, and an Italian might be trusted to be discreet.</p>

<p>Getting a man to hold his horse, he interviewed
Giovanni, and was assured that Delmonico&rsquo;s itself could
not produce a better meal if the signor invited comparison.
The signor wanted nothing elaborate, however.
He admitted he was not well versed in either
menus or wines, but demanded the best, and, after inspecting
a well-furnished room overlooking the street,
lodged a ten-dollar bill as earnest money, with a promise
of ample largess if he were pleased. Then he rode
away to the Ocean House, sent a note to Nancy, and
received a reply which deepened his mystified dismay.</p>

<p>For she wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;Dear Derry, I shall be there at seven-thirty. Meanwhile,
go to the Casino, and tell everybody that you are
summoned to New York on business, and mean to leave
either tonight by the Fall River steamer or by first train
tomorrow. You are traveling by the train to oblige me;
so I am not asking you to indulge in polite fiction.</p>

<p class="ralign">
<span style="margin-right: 2em;">&ldquo;Yours ever,</span><br />
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Nancy</span>.&rdquo;<br />
</p></div>

<p>He carried out instructions to the letter, and was
chaffed mildly for deserting the place just as his
friends were getting to like him. It was easy to promise
a speedy return, if possible; though he felt, somehow,
that he would never see Newport again. The
conclusion of his horse-dealing transactions took up
a good deal of the afternoon, and, to his regret, Dacre<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
was out with a yachting party; so he left a hurriedly
written message about his pending departure.</p>

<p>Then he strolled out, went downtown by street car,
and met Nancy when she alighted from a rickety cab
at the door of Pestalozzi&rsquo;s caf&eacute;. She wore a cream-tinted
dress, and her piquant features were daintily
framed in a big Leghorn hat. It pleased him to find
that she had not even deigned to veil her face, and her
cheerful cry of recognition showed no conscience-stricken
sense of guilt because of a meeting which, if
known, must have excited the suspicions of her intimates.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, there you are, Derry!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Was there
ever a more punctual person? Am I late? I had such
a load of things to do that I left dressing till the last
moment. Is this where we dine? What a jolly little
caf&eacute;! It is just like hundreds of such establishments
in Rome and Naples. I suppose these Italian restaurateurs
employ their fellow-countrymen as builders
and decorators; so they carry their architecture and
fittings with them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They change their skies, but not their soups,&rdquo; said
Power, falling in with her mood, and the driver of
Nancy&rsquo;s cab recognized the adaptation of Horace&rsquo;s
tag, and was pleased to grin, being himself a broken-down
graduate of Harvard.</p>

<p>Ushered to the dining-room, they tackled the <i>hors
d&rsquo;&#339;uvres</i> at once, and Nancy chatted about current
events with the tranquil self-possession she would have
displayed at Mrs. Van Ralten&rsquo;s dinner-table. The meal,
excellently cooked and deftly served, marched to its
end without a word from her as to its particular pur<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>pose.
She delighted Pestalozzi by taking minute instructions
for the preparation of an exquisite spaghetti,
and even noted the brands of Italian wines which should
be tabled with each course. At half-past eight, when
coffee appeared, she rose:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pay the bill now, Derry,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;We must be
off in five minutes, and I am sure you want to smoke
at least one cigarette in peace. Perhaps Signor Pestalozzi
will be good enough to order a cab?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Signor Pestalozzi was charmed, and decidedly puzzled.
He believed for many a year that those two had
dined at his caf&eacute; for a wager. If any doubter scoffed,
he would say, with appropriate gesture:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sango la Madonna! I tella you he no squeeze-a de
gell, not-ta one time; so, if dey no make-a de bet, what-a
for he give &rsquo;er dat pranzo superbo?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Really, from Giovanni&rsquo;s point of view, there was no
answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell the man to drive us to the Easton&rsquo;s Beach end
of the Cliff Walk,&rdquo; she said nonchalantly, when the cab
was in evidence, and away they went.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is no moon; but these summer nights are
never quite dark,&rdquo; she began, by way of polite conversation.
&ldquo;It ought to be restful tonight down there
by the Atlantic. It is a horrid thing to confess, but
the memories of Venice which are most vivid in my
mind are not connected with St. Mark&rsquo;s or the Doge&rsquo;s
Palace, but center round just such a night as this on
the Lido. Coming back in the gondola, I almost
wanted to slip over the side into the still waters, and
drift away to the unknown.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do we swim tonight, then?&rdquo; he asked.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span></p>

<p>It was a relief to hear his own voice in some such
apparently light-hearted quip. The cab was narrow,
and hung on indifferent springs, and its lurching across
the roadway to avoid other vehicles often threw him
against Nancy&rsquo;s supple body. He could never touch
her without feeling the thrill of contact, and, fight
as he would against it, the desire to clasp her in his
arms and stifle her protests with hot kisses would
come on him at such moments with an almost overwhelming
ecstasy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I led, would you follow, Derry?&rdquo; she whispered.</p>

<p>Heaven help him, it seemed as though she was nestling
close deliberately; yet he refused to believe, and
strove to answer with a jest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have a picture of you and me striking out across
the bay for Narragansett, like a pair of dolphins,&rdquo; he
said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought of you that night on the Lido,&rdquo; she
went on, unheeding. &ldquo;I imagined then that when you
skipped off to Sacramento you had forgotten the little
girl of the Dolores ranch. At any rate, such was
my every-day common-sense sort of belief; but tucked
away in some cute little nerve center of intuition was
another notion, which told me that we had been driven
apart by wicked and deceitful contriving. And now,
thank my stars, I know that my subconscious feeling
was right! Oh, Derry! How you must have despised
me! What if we had not met for many a year, and
you had schooled yourself into real forgetfulness, and
some other girl had crept into a corner of your heart,
thrusting out poor little me forever?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The gathering gloom without had now made the cab<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>&rsquo;s
interior so dark that she could not see the rigid lines
in his face, nor could she make out by any convulsive
movement that his hands were clenched, and that
beads of perspiration stood on his forehead. But she
knew, yes, she knew, and timid fingers caught his
arm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are not to think me mad or cruel to speak
in this way,&rdquo; she cooed. &ldquo;I have looked into my very
soul, Dear, and a great peace has come from my self-communing.
You have wearied your clever brain with
guesses as to my motive in meeting you tonight, and
I giggled like a schoolgirl today at the thought of
your absolute amazement when you read my note bidding
you prepare to leave Newport. But it is all part
and parcel of my plan, Derry, which rests on your
reply to one small question. Do you want to go away
from <i>me</i>? Are you ready to face a world in which
there will be no Nancy, never, no more?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, you are trying me beyond endurance!&rdquo; he almost
sobbed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you <i>must</i> tell me <i>that</i>, Derry. I have gone
a long way daringly. It is my privilege, my right. If
you love me, you must expect it of me, because, as
things are, I am forced to take the first step. But a
woman must be sure that she is loved, and her lover
alone can still her doubts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>An impulse stronger than his own strength of will
brought strange, wild words to his dry lips.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nancy,&rdquo; he said, with the calm accents of despair,
&ldquo;I have never loved any woman but you, and, God
willing, I never shall!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is all that really matters,&rdquo; she sighed, with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
a contented note in her voice that rang in his ears
like a chord of sweet music heard from afar in the
depths of a forest.</p>

<p>After that they sat in silence, she seemingly wrapped
in dreams, and he wandering in a maze wherein impassable
walls showed no gateway of escape; though
the guarded path was alluring, and the air was heavy
with the scent of flowers.</p>

<p>The cab stopped, and they alighted; for Nancy, demurely
self-controlled, announced that she meant to
take him for a stroll along the Cliff Walk. Power,
deaf and blind to externals, would have accompanied
her straightway; but she laughingly called him back
from the clouds.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell the cabman to wait,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and give him
some money, or the poor fellow will think that we have
come this long way from town purposely, and mean to
go off without payment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He handed the driver a subsidy which caused the
man to avow his willingness to wait till morning if necessary.
Once away from the main road, and with no
other company than the stars and the sea, Nancy took
her escort&rsquo;s arm, and kept step with him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m perversely disinclined to discuss
personal affairs until we reach a certain rock at
the foot of the Forty Steps. I mean to sit on that
rock, and you will curl up on the shingle at my feet,
and light a nice-smelling cigar, and listen while I explain
the method in my madness of the last twenty-four
hours. But I cannot arrange my thoughts in sequence
till we are settled there comfortably. In the meantime,
I&rsquo;ll make you acquainted with my best friend,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
the Duchesse de Brasnes, whom you will meet some
day in Paris, I hope, and then you will see for yourself
some of her delightful eccentricities which I&rsquo;ll
recount to you now, and you will laugh quietly and say,
&lsquo;What an observant little person that Nancy is! Now,
who&rsquo;d have thought she could quiz and con a great
lady of the Faubourg so accurately?&rsquo; But you&rsquo;re not
to misunderstand my joking; for the duchess is a dear,
and I&rsquo;m very fond of her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To this day Power has never recalled a single syllable
of Nancy&rsquo;s utterances concerning one of the leaders
of Parisian society. All that he knew, or cared
to know, was that the voice of his beloved was murmuring
words which were curiously soothing to his tingling
nerves. By this time he had cast scruples to the
winds. His mind was armored with triple steel against
any other consideration than that Nancy was by his
side, that her hand rested confidently on his wrist,
that he could feel her slender arm warm and soft near
his heart.</p>

<p>And the supreme moment was rushing upon him with
the wings of love on a summer&rsquo;s night, than which no
flight of bird is so swift and noiseless. They reached
the top of the rocky staircase, and began to descend.
A fairy radiance from off the dark-blue mirror of the
Atlantic made plain each downward step; but Nancy
wore the high-heeled shoes which women affected then
more generally than is the fashion today, and Power
held her hand lest she slipped and fell. Thus they made
their way to the beach, until they had almost negotiated
the last short flight. Power, indeed, was standing
on the shingle, and the girl&mdash;for, married woman<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
though she was, her years were still those of a girl&mdash;was
poised gracefully on the lowermost slab.</p>

<p>There she hesitated perceptibly. His eyes met hers
in a subtle underlook, and he saw that her face was
deathly white. Yet there was neither fear nor indecision
in her steadfast glance. Even while he asked
dumbly why she waited, her lips parted, she held out
her hands with a gesture of pleading, and she murmured:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Derry, my own dear love, it is not the first
but the last step which counts now!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then he took her in his arms, and their lips met&mdash;and
for her there was no uncertainty ever more.</p>

<h2><small>CHAPTER VIII</small><br />

THE STEP THAT COUNTED</h2>


<p>Of course, being a woman, she made believe that
he had taken her by storm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Derry, dear, how <i>could</i> you?&rdquo; she gasped, all rosy
and breathless, and seemingly much occupied in smoothing
her ruffled plumes during the first lull after the
hurricane.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You witch, who could resist you?&rdquo; he muttered,
showing well-marked symptoms of another attack.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, you&rsquo;ll just behave, and sit exactly where I
shall point out!&rdquo; she cried, and her pouting confidence
gave eloquent testimony to the passing of an indelible
phase in their relations. &ldquo;And I am not a witch; but
if you find it necessary to resist me, as you put it&mdash;&mdash; Well,
there! only this once. We <i>must</i> sit down and
be serious. I have such a lot to say, and so little time
in which to say it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The new note struck by the unfettered intimacy of
her manner exercised an influence which Power would
have regarded as a fantastic impossibility during those
moments of delirium when first she clung to him, and
both were shaken by irrepressible tumult. It said, far
more plainly than impassioned speech, that she had
thrown down all barriers, that she had counted the cost,
and was giving herself freely and gladly to her mate.
The recognition of this supreme surrender by a proud<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
woman, a woman to whom purity of thought was as
the breath of life, administered a beneficial shock to
his sorely tried nerves. Had a brilliant meteor flashed
suddenly through space, and rushed headlong toward
that part of the Atlantic which lapped the southern
shore of Rhode Island, it could not have illuminated
land and sea with more incisive clarity than did Nancy&rsquo;s
attitude light up the dark places of his mind. Some
stupendous thing had happened which would account
for this miracle, and he must endeavor to understand.
No matter what the effort needed, he must attend to
her every word. In his inmost heart he knew that
he cared not a jot what set of circumstances had
brought about a development which he had not dared
to dream of. He recked little of the cause now that
its effect was graven on tablets more lasting than brass.
But it was due to Nancy that he should be able to follow
and appreciate her motives. He held fast to that
thought in the midst of a vertigo. A waking nightmare
had been changed in an instant into a beatitude
akin, perilously akin, to that of the man and woman
who found each other in the one perfect garden which
this gray old world has seen, and no darkling vision
of desert wastes and thorn-choked paths tortured the
happy lovers now gazing fearlessly into each other&rsquo;s
shining eyes. The heritage of &ldquo;man&rsquo;s first disobedience&rdquo;
might oppress them all too soon; but, for that
night at least, it lay hidden behind the veil. Exercising
no slight command on his self-control, therefore, Power
strove to revert to the well-ordered coherency of speech
and action which he had schooled himself to adopt
when in Nancy&rsquo;s presence.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Forgive me if I have seemed rather mad,&rdquo; he
pleaded, seating himself at her feet, and simulating a
calmness which resembled the placid center of a cyclone.
&ldquo;During three long years I have hungered for the taste
of your lips, Dear. That is my excuse, and it should
serve; for I was content to wait as many decades if
Fate kept firm in her resolve to deny you to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You would never have yielded if I had not used
a woman&rsquo;s guile?&rdquo; she said, half questioning him, half
stating a truism beyond reach of argument.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is little of guile in your nature, Nancy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I think that is true, too; but it is equally
true that a woman often takes what I may call a saner
view of life than a man. She is quicker to admit the
logic of accepted facts. If you discovered that some
girl had won by false pretense, not your love, for love
gilds the grossest clay, but your respect, as her husband,
you would not spurn her with the loathing I feel
now for the man who made me his wife. For that is
what it has come to. I refuse to pose as Hugh Marten&rsquo;s
wife in the eyes of the world one moment longer
than is needful to obtain my freedom. His wife I have
never been in the eyes of Heaven, because my Heaven
is a place of love and content, and I have neither loved
my husband nor been content with him, not for a
single instant. Our marriage began with a lie, and has
endured on a basis of lies. Such contracts, I believe,
are void in law, and the principle which governs men
in business should at least apply to that most solemn
of all engagements, the lifelong union of husband and
wife. Hugh Marten conspired with my father&mdash;hired
him, I might rather say&mdash;to drive you and me apart,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
Derry. The stronger and more subtle brain devised
the means, and left it to the weaker one to carry out
the scheme in sordid reality. As for me, I was helpless
as a caged bird. How was I to guess that Marten,
whom I knew only as the owner of the Bison mines and
mills, had planned my capture? Even my poor, weak
father did not suspect it till you were hundreds of
miles away in California. And then how skilfully was
the trap baited, and how swiftly it worked! You had
not reached Sacramento before a lawyer wrote from
Denver warning my father that the mortgagees were
about to foreclose on the ranch. On several occasions
previously he had been in arrears with the interest on
the loan; but they had always proved considerate, and
their just claims were met, sooner or later. Yet, in
a year when scores of well-to-do ranchers were pressed
for money, and when clemency became almost a right,
these people proved implacable, and swooped down on
him like a hawk on a crippled pigeon.... Derry, <i>you</i>
bought the place&mdash;who were they?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not know. I dealt through a lawyer, and
the vendor was Mr. Willard. He sold the property free
of any encumbrance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yet local opinion credited you and Mac with being
a shrewd pair!&rdquo; she commented, laughing softly,
as if she were reviewing some tragi-comedy in a quizzical
humor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We certainly wondered why Marten made things
so easy for us&mdash;in other respects,&rdquo; he volunteered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, then, you <i>did</i> have a glimmering suspicion of
the truth? I guessed it; though I could not be absolutely
certain till yesterday morning, when Mr. Benson<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
refused to answer my pointblank question. He would
not lie, but he dared not tell the truth; so he fell back
on the feeble subterfuge that, after the mighty interval
of three and a half years, he could not recall the
exact facts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Benson? Did you write to him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The surprise in Power&rsquo;s voice was not feigned. He
was beginning to see now something of the fixed purpose
which had governed her actions during the past
twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said composedly. &ldquo;It was hardly necessary,
but I wanted to dispose of my last doubt; though
in my own mind I was sure of the ground already.
My father went straight to Denver on receipt of that
letter, and, of course, chanced to travel by the same
train as Hugh Marten, the man to whom the whole
amount of the mortgage was little more than a day&rsquo;s
income. Marten was gracious, the lawyer-man adamant.
Within a week I was told of a new suitor, and of my
father&rsquo;s certain and complete ruin if I refused him....
Ah, me! How I wept!... When did you post
your first letter, Derry?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Two days after I arrived at the placer mine,&rdquo; he
replied unhesitatingly. The chief revelation in Nancy&rsquo;s
story was her crystal-clear knowledge of facts which,
he flattered himself, he had kept from her ken. Then
his heart leaped at the thought that she had known
of his love from the night they met in the dining-room
of the Ocean House. But he choked back the rush of
sentiment; for she was demanding his close attention.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I wrote on or about that same date,&rdquo; she went
on. &ldquo;My father&mdash;Heaven forgive him!&mdash;stole your let<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>ters
to me; but the scheme for suppressing my letters
to you must have been concocted before you went to
Sacramento. Such foul actions are unforgivable! I,
for one, refuse to be bound by the fetters which they
forged. I come to you, my dear, as truly your wife,
as unstained in soul and body, as though Hugh Marten
had never existed!&rdquo;</p>

<p>A sudden note of passion vibrated in her voice,
and Power realized, by a lightning flash of intuition,
with what vehement decision she had severed already
the knot which seemed to bind her so tightly. He fancied
it was her due that he should endeavor to relax
an emotional strain which was becoming unbearable.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a mighty good thing we are Americans,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;Here divorce is neither hard to obtain nor
highly objectionable in its methods. We&mdash;at any rate,
I&mdash;must consult some lawyer of experience. The laws
differ in the various states. That which is murder and
sudden death in Ohio is a five-dollar proposition in
Illinois; but the legal intellect will throw light on our
difficulty. Meanwhile&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He stopped awkwardly, aware that, although she was
apparently listening to his words, they were making
no impression on her senses. A sudden silence fell, and
the hitherto unheeded noises of the night smote on his
ears with uncanny loudness. The leisured plash of
waves so tiny that they might not be dignified by the
name of breakers swelled into a certain strength and
volume as his range of hearing spread, and the faint
cries of invisible sea-fowl now jarred loudly on the
quietude of nature. A pebble rolled down the cliff,
and he could mark its constantly accelerated leaps<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
until it reached the shingle with a crash which, even
to a case-hardened pebble, betokened damage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Meanwhile&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; prompted Nancy, in a still, small
voice.</p>

<p>So she had followed what he was saying. What was
it that he meant to say? Something about the rocks
and shoals that lay ahead before he could take her
to some safe anchorage. Nevertheless, he shied off
at a tangent, and chose haphazard the one topic which
his sober judgment might have avoided.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was about to utter a banal remark; but it may
as well be put on record and dismissed,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It
is fortunate that I am a rich man. Mere weight of
money can achieve nothing against us; while the possession
of ample means will simplify matters in so
far as we are concerned personally.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Were those really the words on the tip of your
tongue, Derry?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, no,&rdquo; he admitted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you afraid of hurting my feelings?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are right, Dear. As between you and me
there should be no concealment. We have to face the
immediate future. We must consider how to surmount
the interval, short though it may be&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Interval! What interval?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You cannot secure a divorce without some sort
of legal process, and the law refuses to be hurried.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes. Divorce&mdash;law&mdash;they are words which
have little meaning here and now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But they are all-important. Awhile ago you spoke
of your Paris friends, and there are others, like Mrs.
Van Ralten, whose sympathies and help will be of real<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
value in years to come. You see, I want you to hold
your pretty little head higher as Mrs. John Darien
Power than you ever held it as Mrs. Hugh Marten.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That will cost no great effort, Derry. If we have
to pass through an ordeal of publicity, we can surely
use the vile means for our own ends, so that our friends
may know the whole truth.... Derry, if you were not
such a good and honorable man, you would not be so
dense.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In his anxiety to follow each twist and turn of her
reasoning he had crept nearer, and was now on his
knees, having imprisoned her hands in his, and peering
intently into her face. In that dim light her eyes shone
like faintly luminous twin stars, and he laughed joyously
when, to his thinking, he had solved the doubt
that was troubling her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If it will help any that all the world should know
that I, the aforesaid John Darien Power, have been,
and am, and will ever remain frantically in love with
a lady heretofore described as Nancy Willard, I shall
nail a signed statement to that effect on the Casino
notice-board tomorrow morning,&rdquo; he vowed.</p>

<p>She gently released her hands, placed them lovingly
on his cheeks, and drew him close, so that he could not
choose but yield to any demand she might make.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Derry,&rdquo; she said, kissing him with that soothing
air of maternity which is a woman&rsquo;s highest endowment,
&ldquo;though I am going to say something dreadfully
forward and bold, I shall risk all lest I lose you,
and, if that happens, my poor heart will break and be
at rest forever. Even now you do not see whither I
am leading you. You never would see unless I spoke<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
plainly. My love for you may be fierce and terrible;
but I am only a weak woman, a woman just emerged
from girlhood, and I want to be saved from myself.
If, for your dear sake, I am to cut adrift from the
past, I cannot be left alone. By your side I can face
the storm, but I shudder at the thought of protests,
appeals, influences perhaps more potent than I imagine
in my present new-found mood of hatred of the wrong
which has been done me. Derry, why, do you think,
have I asked you to leave Newport early tomorrow?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Stirred by a common impulse, they both stood upright.
All at once she seemed to be unable to bear
his burning gaze any longer, and her head sank on
his breast. He had thrown a protecting arm around
her shoulders, and he felt her supple body quiver under
a sob which she tried to restrain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nancy,&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;am I to take you with
me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said brokenly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean that we are to be a law unto ourselves,
and thereby make divorce proceedings inevitable? I
must put it that way, my dear one! I must understand!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Derry. You <i>must</i> understand. There is no
other way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He held her so tightly that he became aware of
the mad racing of her heart, and a great pity stirred
his inmost core. How she must have suffered! What
agony was this forced discarding, one by one, of her
maidenly defenses! Though he had been blind and
deaf solely because of the depth and intensity of his
love and reverence, he could utter now only a halting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
plea that would explain his slowness of perception.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Forgive me, Dear!&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;I can find
nothing better to say than that&mdash;forgive me! I was
so absorbed in my own dream of happiness that I gave
no heed to the means. But I shall never again be so
thoughtless.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thoughtless!&rdquo; She raised her sweet face once
more, tear-stained and smiling. &ldquo;You thoughtless,
Derry? Women thank God for that sort of thoughtlessness
in men like you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And with that, before he could forestall or even
divine her intention, she had withdrawn from his embrace,
and had run lightly up half a dozen of the Forty
Steps.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come!&rdquo; she cried, with an alteration of manner
and voice that was almost stupefying to her hearer.
&ldquo;We have been here an unconscionable time, and just
think how awful it will be if our cabman has taken home
his tired horse! Of course, even at the twelfth hour,
I have loads of things to pack. And, since I don&rsquo;t know
where I am going, the task of selecting a reasonable
stock of clothes is too appalling for words. Oh, don&rsquo;t
gaze at me as if I were a ghost, Derry! I am not about
to flit away into space. You will have another half
hour of my company; because, let that poor horse do
his best, we sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t reach our respective habitations till
long after eleven o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yet she was neither excited nor hysterical. A great
load had been lifted off her heart, and her naturally
gay temperament was asserting itself with vital insistence.
There was no possibility of drawing back now.
Nothing but death could separate her from her lover.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
Nothing but death! Well, that separation must come
in the common order of things; but a bright road
stretched before her mind&rsquo;s eye through a long vista of
years, and her spirit sang within her and rejoiced exceedingly.
No shred of doubt or hesitation remained.
She had passed already through the storm, and though
its clouds might roll in sullen thunder among distant
hills yet awhile, the particular hilltop on which she
stood was bathed in sunlight.</p>

<p>Above all else, despite her complete trust in Power,
she thrilled with the consciousness that her love contained
a delicious spice of fear, and that is why she
climbed the Forty Steps in a sort of panic; so that
he marveled at her change of mood, and discovered in
it only one more of the enchantments with which his
fancy clothed her.</p>

<p>The driver regarded them as a moonstruck couple,
since that sort of moon shines ever on fine evenings by
the sea. He was obviously surprised when the lady&rsquo;s
address was given, because he expected a return journey
to one of Newport&rsquo;s many boarding-houses; but
any suspicions he may have entertained were dispelled
when he witnessed a polite farewell in the presence of
a pompous butler, and heard Nancy say:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am going straight to my room now to write that
letter to my father. Then I shall finish packing.
What time is the train&mdash;nine o&rsquo;clock. Goodnight,
Derry! Sleep well!&rdquo;</p>

<p>If he thought at all about the matter, the cabman
might well have imagined that no young lady in Newport
that night had used words less charged with
explosive properties; yet no giant cannon on the war<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>ships
swinging to their moorings in the bay could have
rivaled the uproar those few simple sentences might
create. Moreover, he heard the gentleman address the
butler by name, and witnessed the transference of a
tip, accompanied by the plain statement that the giver
was leaving Newport early next day. Indeed, once
he had deposited his fare at the Ocean House, the man
probably gave no further heed to one or other of the
pair who had some foolish liking for a prolonged stroll
on the cliffs overlooking the Atlantic, nor, to his knowledge,
did he ever again see them, or even hear their
names spoken of.</p>

<p>Power was crossing the veranda with his alert, uneven
strides when a voice came out of the gloom:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hullo, Power, that you? Come and join me in a
parting drink.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was Dacre, the one person in the hotel from whom
such an invitation was not an insufferable nuisance at
the moment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m in a bit of a hurry,&rdquo; said Power, &ldquo;as I am off
tomorrow morning; but I&rsquo;m glad to find you here.
You&rsquo;ve received my note?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. Sit down. I&rsquo;m just going to light a cigar,
and the match will help you to mix your own poison.
Had a pleasant evening?&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was a natural though curiously pertinent question;
but Power was at no loss for an answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have really been arranging certain details as a
preliminary to my departure,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where are you bound for, New York?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;After some days, or weeks, perhaps. I hardly
know yet.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve changed your plans, it seems?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Power remembered then that he had invited the Englishman
to visit Colorado. It was practically settled
that Dacre should come West within three weeks or
a month.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By Jove!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;you must accept my apologies.
Of course, I would have recalled our fixture in
good time, and have written postponing your trip to
Bison. Circumstances beyond my control will prevent
my return home for an indefinite period. I can&rsquo;t tell
you how sorry I am.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Same here,&rdquo; said the other, with John Bull directness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But neither of us is likely to shuffle off the map
yet awhile,&rdquo; continued Power. &ldquo;You have my address,
both in Colorado and at my New York bank, and I
have yours. Keep me posted as to your movements,
and we shall come together again later in the year.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was eager to dissipate a certain starchiness, not
wholly unjustifiable, which he thought he could detect
in his companion&rsquo;s manner; but the discovery of its true
cause disconcerted him more than he cared to acknowledge,
even to himself. Enlightenment was not long
delayed. Dacre&rsquo;s evident lack of ease arose from circumstances
vastly more important than the disruption
of his own plans; he hesitated only because he was
searching for the right way to express himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You and I have cultivated quite a friendship since
we forgathered here nearly three weeks ago,&rdquo; he began,
after a pause which Power again interpreted
mistakenly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed. Won&rsquo;t you let me explain&mdash;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not just yet. You are on the wrong tack, Power.
You believe I&rsquo;m rather cut up about the postponement
of your invitation. Not a bit of it. This little globe
cannot hold two men like you and me, and keep us apart
during the remainder of our naturals. No, mine is a
different sort of grouch. Now, I&rsquo;m a good deal older
than you. You won&rsquo;t take amiss anything I tell you,
providing I make it clear that I mean well?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can guarantee that, at any rate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Power&rsquo;s reply was straightforward enough; but his
tone was cold and guarded. The chill of premonition
had fallen on him. A man whom he liked and respected
was about to fire the first shot on behalf of
unctuous rectitude and the conventions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I may as well open with a broadside,&rdquo; said Dacre,
unwittingly adopting the simile of social warfare which
had occurred to his hearer. &ldquo;I was out with a yachting
party this afternoon, and we were becalmed. Three
of us came away from the New York Yacht Club&rsquo;s boathouse
about half-past eight, and took a street-car in
preference to one of those rickety old cabs. Luckily,
by the accident of position, I was the only one of the
three who saw a lady and gentleman come out of an
Italian restaurant. The presence of two such people in
that locality was unusual, to say the least; but, as the
man was a friend of mine, and the lady one whom I
admire and respect, I said nothing to the other fellows.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That was thoughtful of you,&rdquo; broke in Power, half
in sarcasm; for he was vastly irritated that he had not
contrived affairs more discreetly, and half in genuine
recognition of Dacre&rsquo;s tact.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The thinking came later,&rdquo; said the Englishman<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
slowly. &ldquo;When all is said and done, a little dinner
<i>&agrave; l&rsquo;Italienne</i> might pass by way of a joke&mdash;a harmless
escapade at the best, or worst. But, when I reach my
hotel and find a note announcing that the man is leaving
Newport unexpectedly, and when I hear at the
Casino that the woman also is arranging to meet her
father in New York, with equal unexpectedness, I am
inclined to ask the man, he being something more than
a mere acquaintance, if there is not a very reasonable
probability that he is making a damned fool of himself.
Now, are we going to discuss this thing rationally,
or do you want to hit me with a heavy
siphon? If the latter, kindly change your mind, and
let&rsquo;s talk about the next race for the America&rsquo;s Cup.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here no solemn diapason of wave and shingle relieved
an unnerving silence. Not even the distant rumble
of a vehicle broke the tension. The hour was late
for ordinary traffic, early for diners and dancers. A
deep hush lay on the hotel and its garden. It was
so dark that the street lamps, twinkling few and far
between the trees, appeared to diffuse no larger area
of light than so many fireflies.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are we alone here?&rdquo; said Power, speaking only
when an uneasy movement on Dacre&rsquo;s part bestirred
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. I saw to that when I heard your cab. I
timed you to a nicety.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must be experienced in these matters.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have been most sorts of an idiot in my time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are quite sure we are not overheard?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As sure as a man can be of anything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I recognize your right to question me. To<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>night
you, tomorrow all Newport, will know what has
happened&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pardon an interruption. Women are invariably
careful of the hour, howsoever heedless they may be
of next week. Newport knows nothing, will know nothing,
except that a popular lady is meeting her father
in New York, the said father having written to say
he is coming East. His letter is Exhibit A, yours
to me Exhibit B, or it would be if it weren&rsquo;t
burnt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A legal jargon is not out of place. When the lady
in question has secured a divorce she will become my
wife. Now you have the true explanation of my seeming
discourtesy. When I am married, I shall entertain
you at Bison if I have to escort you from Tokio,
or even from Sing Sing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are no &lsquo;buts.&rsquo; She was stolen from me, decoyed
away by the tricks of the pickpocket and the
forger. I am merely regaining possession of my own.
It was not I who cleared up the theft. That was her
doing. There can be no shirking the consequences.
If my mother, whom I love and venerate, implored me
on her bended knees to draw back now from the course
I have mapped out, I would stop my ears to her pleading,
because I could not yield to it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s like that, is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just like that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dacre struck another match, and relighted the cigar
which he had allowed to go out after the first whiff
or two. Power noticed that the flare of the match was
not used as an excuse for scrutinizing him, because his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
friend&rsquo;s eyes were studiously averted. Then came the
quiet, cultured voice from the darkness:</p>

<p>&ldquo;If that&rsquo;s the position, old man, I wish you every
sort of good luck, and a speedy end to your worries,
and I&rsquo;ll come at your call to that ranch of yours, from
the other end of the earth, if need be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Again a little pause. Then Power spoke:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You ring like true metal all the time, Dacre. May
I ask you one thing&mdash;are you married?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, nor ever likely to be. I&mdash;I lost her, not by
fraud, but by my own folly. But she understood&mdash;before
she died. That is my only consolation. It must
suffice. It has sufficed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry. I touched that chord unthinkingly. I
merely wanted to have your full comprehension&mdash;and
sympathy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You had both already. I would not have dared
to intrude if I did not realize that a man talking to
another man can raise points which are lost sight of
when a woman&mdash;<i>the</i> woman&mdash;is the other party to the
debate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Would you care to hear a brief record of my life
during the last few years?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go right ahead! I&rsquo;m not a gossip. If I know
something of the truth, I may be able to stop a rill
of scandal one of these days. There&rsquo;s bound to be
chatter, even though old Mr. Willard comes East.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know the name, then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly. Mrs. Van Ralten was speaking about
him tonight&mdash;not very favorably, either. Said she
couldn&rsquo;t understand how such a man could have such
a daughter.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Van Ralten is a remarkably intelligent
woman,&rdquo; said Power dryly. &ldquo;I never saw Nancy&rsquo;s
mother; but I imagine that this is a case of exclusive
heredity, because there never were two more diverse
natures than Nancy&rsquo;s and her father&rsquo;s. She is the soul
of honor, and would give her life for a principle; while
he bartered his own daughter for a few thousand dollars.
If I were not convinced of that, do you believe
I would besmirch her good name and my own by so
much as tonight&rsquo;s mild adventure in an Italian caf&eacute;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can give you easy assurance on that head. I
have seldom been so surprised as when I saw the pair
of you leaving the place and entering a cab.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That was a mere episode, a first meek onslaught
on the proprieties, so to speak. You will understand
fully when I have told you the whole story.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They talked, or rather Power talked and Dacre listened,
till a clock struck twelve somewhere. Carriages
began to roll along the neighboring avenues, and lamps
occasionally flitted past the hotel. Two or three vivacious
groups crossed the veranda, and a porter
turned on a lamp. Then Power found that his English
friend had placed their chairs in a sort of alcove formed
by a disused doorway flanked on each hand by a huge
palm growing in a wooden tub which held a ton of
earth, or more; so they were well screened.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You meant to force me to confess,&rdquo; he said,
smiling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. It might have been merely folly on your
part.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now it is Fate&rsquo;s own contriving. You don&rsquo;t want<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
to escape; but you couldn&rsquo;t if you did. Or, that is
awkwardly put. What I mean is&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dacre&rsquo;s meaning was clear enough; but he never completed
the sentence. A cab, laden with luggage, drove
up, and a slightly built, elderly man alighted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This the Ocean House?&rdquo; he inquired, when a porter
hurried forward.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; and the man took a portmanteau from
the driver.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hold on, there! I&rsquo;m not sure I shall want a room.
How far is &lsquo;The Breakers&rsquo; from here, Mrs. Marten&rsquo;s
house?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quite a ways,&rdquo; said the cabman. &ldquo;Two miles an&rsquo;
a bit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The new arrival seemed to consider the distance and
the lateness of the hour.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is Mrs. Marten in Newport, do you know?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yep. I tuk her downtown this evenin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alone?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Guess that&rsquo;s so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where was she going?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wall, ye see, I was on the box, an&rsquo; de lady was
inside; so we didn&rsquo;t git anyways sociable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The stranger evidently bethought himself, and turned
to the porter again. He could not know that a
Harvard man was merely speaking in the vernacular.
&ldquo;Have you a Mr. Power staying here?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is he here now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If he isn&rsquo;t in the hotel, he&rsquo;ll be at the Casino.
Shall I ring up his room, sir?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no. I&rsquo;ll see him in the morning. It&rsquo;s too late<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
to go any farther tonight, and I&rsquo;m rather tired and
shaken up. My train was derailed, and we are hours
behind time. Give me a decent room. I suppose I
can have breakfast at eight o&rsquo;clock?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Any time you like, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The cab went off, and the inquisitive visitor entered
the building. The two men seated behind the palms
had not uttered a syllable while the foregoing conclave
was in progress.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Francis Willard, I presume?&rdquo; murmured
Dacre, when the retreating footsteps had died away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Power.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Three days ahead of the time stated in his letter,
I presume further.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That must be so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Foxy. He fits your description. What are you
going to do now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Finish my yarn, if I am not wearying you, and
leave Newport at seven <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> instead of nine-ten. The
fox broke cover just a little too soon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By gad, yes! I think I&rsquo;ll recognize that cabman
again. If I come across him, I&rsquo;ll tip him for you. He
deserves it.... The swine! To start pumping the
townsfolk before he was ten seconds in the place, and
about his own daughter, too! Dash his eyes&mdash;wait till
someone refers him to me for news of you! I&rsquo;ll head
him into the open country quick enough&mdash;trust me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dacre&rsquo;s comments might sound rather incoherent;
but it was painfully evident that Nancy&rsquo;s father had
created a bad first impression, and he was one of those
unhappy mortals who could not afford to do that, because
he never survived it.</p>

<h2><small>CHAPTER IX</small><br />

THE CHASE</h2>


<p>In the morning Power&rsquo;s first care was to ascertain
the position of the room allotted to Willard. As he
imagined, it proved to be in the back part of the
hotel, every apartment in the front section being occupied
by season residents. Shortly before six o&rsquo;clock,
therefore, he drove away in an open carriage, confident
that nothing short of an almost incredible chance would
bring the older man to vestibule or porch at that early
hour. Halting the vehicle at a corner near Nancy&rsquo;s
abode, he walked to the house, and surprised the earliest
servants astir by bidding one of them wake Mrs.
Marten at once, as he had news of her father.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing serious,&rdquo; he added, with a reassuring smile
at a housemaid whose alarmed face showed an immediate
sense of disaster. &ldquo;Mrs. Marten is leaving Newport
today, I think, and my message may decide her
to start sooner&mdash;that is all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Nancy had seen him from her bedroom window,
and now fluttered downstairs in a dressing gown.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it, Derry?&rdquo; she asked, and mistress and
maid evidently shared the feminine belief that such an
untimely call presaged something sensational and therefore
sinister.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be frightened,&rdquo; he said cheerfully, knowing
how essential it was that she should not be startled<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
into an exclamation which might betray her secret to
the listening servants. &ldquo;I heard from Dacre last night
that you meant to meet Mr. Willard in New York,
and I have reason to believe that you ought to depart
by the first train. To do that, you must get away
from the house in forty minutes. Can you manage
it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She came nearer, seeking the truth in his warning
eyes, carrying a brave front before the maids, but with
fear in her heart, because she and her lover had eaten
of the forbidden fruit, and now they were as gods,
knowing good and evil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Dacre!&rdquo; she repeated. &ldquo;I suppose Mary
Van Ralten told him what I said. But I don&rsquo;t quite
understand. Why should I hurry my departure?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nothing in this that anyone might hear and deem
significant. Power laughed, as though her air of slight
alarm had amused him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come into the veranda,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You are not
afraid of the morning air, and it is not on my conscience
that I have robbed you of an hour&rsquo;s sleep, since
you were up and around before I arrived.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When they were alone, though shut off from inquisitive
ears by wire-screen doors only, he said, in a low
voice:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say anything that will cause comment, but
your father arrived at the Ocean House soon after
midnight, and means to be here about nine o&rsquo;clock.
Our train leaves at seven. Will you use your own carriage,
or shall I send a cab in half an hour? You will
be ready, of course?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nancy was not of that neurotic type of womankind<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
which screams or faints in a crisis. &ldquo;Y-yes,&rdquo; she murmured.
&ldquo;In less time, if you wish.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No need to rush things,&rdquo; he said coolly. &ldquo;He is
not to be called till eight. I heard him give the
order.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You <i>heard</i> him!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. Thanks to Dacre, when he arrived I was sitting
in the veranda, well hidden, as it happened; so
I planned to reach you this morning with a couple of
hours in hand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, Derry, I have a note written, and ready for
the post. I can&rsquo;t explain now&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Put the note in your pocket, and deal with the
new situation at leisure. There&rsquo;s only one thing I
regret&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Regret! Oh, Derry, what is it?&rdquo; And again the
shadow of fear darkened her eyes, eyes of that rare
tint of Asiatic blue known as blende Kagoul, a blue
darker at times than any other, and again, bright, dazzling,
full of promise, rivaling the clear sky on a summer&rsquo;s
night.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That I dare not take you in my arms and kiss
you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You look uncommonly pretty in that
neglig&eacute;e wrap.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She blushed, and put up a hand to reassure herself
lest her hair might be tumbling out of its coils. Then
she ran to the screen doors and pushed them apart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t wait another second,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Please
send that cab. Our own men will hardly be at the
stables yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She waved a hand and vanished. Her hurried orders
to the domestics came in the natural sequence of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
things, and caused no surprise. When she drove away
from the house at twenty minutes of seven every member
of her establishment believed that Mrs. Marten had
gone to join her father in New York, but, for some
reason communicated by her &ldquo;cousin,&rdquo; was traveling
by the first train of the day instead of the second.
The only perplexed person left in &ldquo;The Breakers&rdquo;
was Julie, the French maid, who thought she would
find a holiday in Newport dull, and was, moreover,
genuinely concerned because of the scanty wardrobe
which her mistress had taken.</p>

<p>Oddly enough, Power, waiting with stoic anxiety outside
the New York, New Haven &amp; Hartford station,
shared some part of Julie&rsquo;s thought when he saw Nancy&rsquo;s
two small steamer trunks and a hatbox.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; he cried, helping her to alight. &ldquo;Here have
I been worrying about the capacity of the cab to hold
your baggage, and you bring less than I!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pay the man,&rdquo; she said quietly. Then, under
cover of the approach of a porter with a creaking
barrow, she added, &ldquo;I am coming to you penniless and
plainly clad as ever was Nancy Willard. You wish that,
don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You dear!&rdquo; he breathed; but she had her full answer
in the color that suffused his bronzed face and
the light that blazed in his eyes.</p>

<p>He had experienced no difficulty in securing the small
coup&eacute; of a Pullman car to Boston. In that train there
was little likelihood of any chance passenger recognizing
them. In actual fact, they had the whole car
to themselves. Nancy, who could not banish the notion
that the whole world was watching her, was ner<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>vous
and ill at ease until the train pulled out of the
station. She even started and flushed violently when
the conductor came to examine their tickets, whereupon
the man smiled discreetly and Power laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the poorest sort of conspirator,&rdquo; he said,
when the door was closed on the intruder. &ldquo;We had
better admit straight away that we&rsquo;re a honeymoon
couple, because everybody will know it the instant they
look at you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But he failed to charm away the terror that oppressed
her spirit. She felt herself a fugitive from
some unseen but awful vengeance, and her heart quailed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Derry,&rdquo; she said, almost on the verge of tears, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
beginning to be afraid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Afraid of what?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Somehow, despite his utter lack of experience of
woman&rsquo;s ways, he had guessed that this moment would
arrive, and was, to that extent, prepared for it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of everything. I&mdash;I know that I alone am to
blame. It is not too late for you to draw back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why do you think I might wish to draw back?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because of the horrid exposure you must face
in the near future.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My only trouble is that I may not bear your share
as well as my own, Nancy. The combined burden
would lie light as thistledown on my shoulders. Let
us be true to ourselves, and it will surprise you to find
how readily the world, our world, will accept our view.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In your heart of hearts, Derry, do you believe we
are doing right?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When ethics come in at the door love flies out by the
window. We are righting a grievous wrong, and, al<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>though
our actions must, for a time, be opposed to
the generally accepted code of morals, I do honestly
believe that this is a case in which the end justifies the
means.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I were stronger, Dear, we might have kept within
stricter bounds.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You might have gone to Reno, for instance, and
qualified for a divorce by residence?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Something of the sort.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take you to Reno, if you like; but I&rsquo;m going
with you. Don&rsquo;t forget that he who has begun has
accomplished half. Why are you torturing yourself,
little woman? Shall I tell you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish you would.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; and his arms were thrown around her,
and he kissed away the tears trembling on her lashes,
&ldquo;because, like me, you are really afraid lest we may
be too happy. But life is not built on those lines,
Deary. It would still hold its tribulations if we could
set the calendar back to an April night of three years
ago, and you and I were looking forward with bright
hope to half a century of wedded joy, with never a
cloud on the horizon, and never a memory of dark
and deadly abyss crossed in the bygone years. Let
us, then, not lose heart in full view of the one threatening
storm. Let us rather rejoice that we are facing
it together. That is how I feel, Nancy. I have never
loved you more than in this hour, and why should I
repine because of the greatest gift God can give to
man, the unbounded love and trust of the one woman
he desires? You are mine, Nancy, mine forever, and
I will not let you go till I sink into everlasting night.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>After that, an interlude, when words were impossible,
else both would have sobbed like erring children.
At last Nancy raised her eyes, and smiled up into her
lover&rsquo;s face, and he understood dimly that, when a
woman&rsquo;s conscience wages war with her emotions, there
may come a speedy end to the unequal strife.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Derry,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;have you realized that
I don&rsquo;t know where you are taking me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the battle had ceased ere it had well begun. Perhaps
she was hardly conscious&mdash;if she were, she gave no
sign&mdash;of the crisis dissipated by that simple question.
It closed with a clang the door of retreat. Henceforth
they would dree their weird hand in hand. They would
look only to the future, and stubbornly disregard the
past. Shutting rebellious eyes against a mandate written
in letters of fire, they would seek comfort in Herrick&rsquo;s
time-serving philosophy:</p>

<p class="poem">
&ldquo;Gather ye rosebuds while ye may,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Old Time is still a-flying;</span><br />
And this same flower that smiles today<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Tomorrow will be dying.&rdquo;</span><br />
</p>

<p>The train slackened speed. They were nearing a wayside
station, and they drew apart in confusion like
a pair of lovers surprised in some quiet corner. But
Power laughed softly, and Nancy caught a new note
of content in his voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A nice thing!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;The girl is safe aboard
the lugger, and I don&rsquo;t even tell her to what quarter
of the globe she is being lugged. But the sailing directions
are easy. We breakfast at Boston. Don&rsquo;t
you dare say you cannot eat any breakfast!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can, or I shall, at any rate,&rdquo; she retorted bravely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then Boston will be the best place on earth at
nine o&rsquo;clock. Afterward we take the Burlington road,
and cross Lake Champlain. There&rsquo;s a first-rate hotel
on the west shore, and we stay there tonight. Tomorrow
we plunge into the Adirondacks, and lose ourselves
for as long as we please. How does that program
suit my lady?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whither thou goest&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; she said, and her eyes fell.</p>

<p>Thus did they thrust dull care into the limbo of forgetfulness,
and if there was standing at the gates of
their Eden a frowning angel with a drawn sword, their
vision was clouded, and they could not see him.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>America rises early, even in holiday-making Newport;
so Mr. Francis Willard did not breakfast in solitary
state. When he entered the dining-room at half-past
eight next morning he cast a quick glance around
the well-filled tables, and ascertained instantly that the
one man whom he did not wish to see was absent.</p>

<p>Toward the close of the meal he beckoned the head
waiter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where does Mr. Power sit usually?&rdquo; he inquired.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Over there, sir, with Mr. Dacre, the English gentleman,
at the small table near the second window.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Following directions, Willard noted a good-looking
man, apparently about forty years old, who was studying
the menu intently. As a matter of fact, Dacre
had seen the newcomer&rsquo;s signal, and guessed what it
portended.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, indeed! Mr. Dacre a friend of his?&rdquo; went on
Willard.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;They are often together, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And where is Mr. Power this morning?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He left by the first train, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For some reason this news was displeasing; though
Power&rsquo;s departure made plausible any inquiries concerning
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a nuisance,&rdquo; said Willard. &ldquo;I&mdash;wanted to
meet him. I came here last night for that purpose.
Do you happen to know where he has gone, and for
how long?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The head waiter was not in the habit of answering
questions about his patrons indiscriminately.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say, I&rsquo;m sure, sir,&rdquo; he replied; &ldquo;but if you
were to ask Mr. Dacre he might know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Willard weighed the point. In one respect, he was
candid with himself. He had come to Newport to spy
on Nancy, and, if necessary, to put a prompt and effectual
end to any threatened renewal of her friendship
with Power. The intuition of sheer hatred had
half warned him that the man whom he regarded as
his worst enemy might possibly visit Rhode Island; but
some newspaper paragraph about the purchase of
horses bred in the state of New York had lulled his
suspicions until he chanced to meet Benson at lunch
in the Brown Palace Hotel. Marten&rsquo;s secretary was
worried. He had replied to Nancy&rsquo;s letter the previous
day; but was not quite sure that he had taken
the right line, and he seized the opportunity now to
consult her father. Of course, he did not reveal his
employer&rsquo;s business, and Willard was the last person
with whom he could discuss the mortgage transaction
fully; but he saw no harm in alluding casually to Mrs.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
Marten&rsquo;s curious inquiry, and was relieved to find that
her father agreed with the answer he had given.</p>

<p>The actual truth was that Willard felt too stunned
by the disclosure to trust his own speech. He was well
aware already that Marten had used him as a cat&rsquo;s-paw
in bringing about the marriage; but that phase of the
affair had long ceased to trouble him. The real shock
of Benson&rsquo;s guarded statement lay in Nancy&rsquo;s pointblank
question. Why had she put it? What influence
was at work that such serious thought should be given
to his financial straits of nearly four years ago?</p>

<p>In the upshot, he left Denver by that night&rsquo;s mail;
though the letter in which he spoke tentatively of a
visit to Newport, and of which Nancy had availed herself
in talk with her friends at the Casino, had been
only a day in the post, and, in the ordinary course of
events, demanded a reply before he undertook a journey
of two thousand miles.</p>

<p>And now he was vaguely uneasy. Though he hated
the sight of Power, he wished heartily that the interloper
who had snatched from him the bonanza of the
Dolores Ranch had remained in Newport during this
one day, at least. Yes, he would speak to Power&rsquo;s
British acquaintance, and glean some news of the man
to whom he had done a mortal wrong and therefore
hated with an intensity bordering on mania.</p>

<p>Dacre saw him coming; so it was with the correct air
of polite indifference that he heard himself addressed
by an elderly stranger.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry to disturb you,&rdquo; said Willard, &ldquo;but the
head waiter tells me that your friend, Mr. Power, has
left Newport. As I am anxious to have a word with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
him, I thought that, perhaps, you wouldn&rsquo;t mind telling
me his whereabouts. My name is Willard, and I
arrived here from Denver at a late hour yesterday; at
midnight, in fact, my train having been delayed by an
accident.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nancy&rsquo;s father was well spoken. He owned a certain
distinction of manner and bearing. Like the majority
of undersized men, he was self-assertive by nature;
but education and fifty years of experience had
rounded the angles of his character, and, in a matter
of this sort, he carried himself with agreeable ease.</p>

<p>Dacre was all smiles instantly. &ldquo;What! Mrs. Marten&rsquo;s
father?&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Delighted to meet you!
Sit down, Mr. Willard. Let us become better known
to each other!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Willard was hardly prepared for this cordial recognition;
but he shook hands affably, and seated himself
in Power&rsquo;s chair, as it chanced.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have heard of me from my daughter, I suppose?&rdquo;
he began.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. She was telling Mrs. Van Ralten and several
others, including myself&mdash;let me see, was it last
night at the Casino?&mdash;that you were thinking of coming
East; but I gathered she did not expect you till
a few days later. I was mistaken, evidently.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. I am giving her a surprise. I managed to
get away sooner than I expected, and the prospect of
Newport&rsquo;s Atlantic breezes was so enticing that I just
made a rush for the next train.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you are here, and the long journey is ended,
a pleasant achievement in itself. Was the train accident
a serious one?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Willard supplied details, and his sympathetic hearer
swapped reminiscences of a similar mishap on the
Paris, Lyon et Mediterran&eacute;e Railway. Incidentally, he
wasted quarter of an hour before Willard could bring
him back to the topic of the missing Power.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes&mdash;as to Power,&rdquo; nodded Dacre, seemingly
recalling his questioner&rsquo;s errand. &ldquo;Too bad you didn&rsquo;t
turn up yesterday. Power is off to New York&mdash;made
up his mind on the spur of the moment&mdash;and I rather
fancy he will not be in Newport again this year. Indeed,
I may go so far as to say I am sure he won&rsquo;t,
because he has invited me to his place at Bison&mdash;somewhere
near Denver, isn&rsquo;t it?&mdash;and I am to keep him
posted as to my own movements, so that we can arrange
things to our mutual convenience.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Willard laughed, intending merely to convey his
sense of the absurdity of two men playing hide and
seek across a continent; but Dacre&rsquo;s allusion to Bison
brought a snarl into his mirth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will write to the ranch, I suppose?&rdquo; he inquired
casually.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Dacre, knowing full well that he was
being egged on to reveal any more immediate address
he might have been given.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I can only apologize for troubling you,
and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not at all! What&rsquo;s your hurry? Let&rsquo;s adjourn
to the veranda and smoke.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must go and see my daughter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, fie, Mr. Willard! You, an old married man,
proposing to break in on a lady&rsquo;s toilet at this hour!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My girl is up and dressed hours ago.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, now that I come to think of it, you are
right. Most mornings while Power was here he joined
Mrs. Marten and others for a scamper across the
island, and they were in the saddle by seven-thirty&mdash;never
later.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In such conditions, being essentially a weak man,
Willard was as a lump of modeler&rsquo;s clay in the hands
of a skilled sculptor. He could not resist the notion
of a cigar, he said; of course, it was easy to induce
Dacre to gossip anent the lively doings of the Casino
set. Ultimately, he entered a carriage at ten o&rsquo;clock,
whereat the Briton, watching his departure, smiled
complacently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Heaven forgive me for aiding and abetting any
man in running away with another man&rsquo;s wife,&rdquo; he
communed. &ldquo;But I know Derry and Nancy and Marten,
and now I know Willard, and being a confirmed
idiot, anyhow, I am mighty glad I was able to secure
those young people a pretty useful hour and a quarter
of uninterrupted travel. As we say in Newport,
it should help some.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It had an effect which no one could have foreseen.
It rendered Willard&rsquo;s arrival at &ldquo;The Breakers&rdquo; a
possible thing had he reached Newport that morning,
and thus, by idle chance, closed the mouth of scandal;
for he positively reeled under the shock of the butler&rsquo;s
open-mouthed statement that Mrs. Marten had left the
town by the first train.</p>

<p>The man did not known him; but, being a well-trained
servant, he made, as he thought, a shrewd guess at
the truth.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Surely you are not Mr. Willard, sir?&rdquo; he said
respectfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I am.&rdquo; Simple words enough; yet their utterance
demanded a tremendous effort.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, there has been some mistake, sir,&rdquo; came the
ready theory. &ldquo;Mrs. Marten meant to meet you in
New York, and had arranged to travel by the nine
o&rsquo;clock train this morning; but Mr. Power made an
early call&mdash;you know Mr. Power, sir?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He seemed to have some information about you,
sir, which caused Mrs. Marten to hurry away before
seven. There has been a sad blunder, I&rsquo;m sure. What
a pity! But if you know what hotel Mrs. Marten will
stay at, you can fix matters by a telegram within a
couple of hours.... Aren&rsquo;t you well, sir? Can I get
you anything? Some brandy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>By some occult process of thought, Willard, though
stupefied by rage and dread&mdash;for he never doubted
for a second that Nancy had flown with Power&mdash;held
fast to the one tangible idea that her household was
ignorant, as yet, of the social tornado which had burst
on Newport that morning. Could anything be done
to avert its havoc? God! He must have time to recover
his senses! While choking with passion, he must
be dumb and secret as the grave! A false move now,
the least slip of a tongue aching to rain curses on
Power, and irretrievable mischief would be done. Small
wonder, then, that the butler mistook his pallid fury
for illness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you come into the morning-room, and sit
down, sir?&rdquo; inquired the man sympathetically.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, take me anywhere&mdash;I&rsquo;m dead beat. I&rsquo;ve been
traveling for days in this damned heat.... No! no
brandy, thank you. A glass of water. Mrs. Marten
expected me, you say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir&mdash;at New York.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, my fault&mdash;entirely my fault. I misled her,
not purposely, of course. She gave you no address?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir. Said she would write in a few days,
perhaps within a week; but she imagined your movements
were uncertain, and she could decide nothing till
she had seen you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, the devil take it, my fault! I ought to have
telegraphed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He harped on this string as promising some measure
of safety for the hour. By this time he was seated,
and ostensibly sipping iced water, while his frenzied
brain was striving to find an excuse to encourage the
man to talk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps Mrs. Marten may return when she discovers
her mistake,&rdquo; he contrived to say with some show
of calmness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, sir, that may happen, of course. My mistress
did not take any large supply of clothing, and
left her maid here; so, when she misses you in New
York, she will probably wire for Julie, at any rate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Julie?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The French maid, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What time did Mr. Power call?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very early, sir. About six o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Willard was slowly gaining a semblance of self-control.
He realized that he had been checkmated in
some inexplicable way; but it was imperative that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
Power&rsquo;s interference should not give ground for suspicion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am beginning to grasp the situation now,&rdquo; he
said, forcing a ghastly smile. &ldquo;Mr. Power heard of
the accident to my train&mdash;it was derailed late last
night&mdash;and, fearing lest I might be injured, he hurried
Mrs. Marten away without telling her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you came by way of New York, sir?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. We were held up near Groton.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pity you didn&rsquo;t come by the Fall River steamer,
sir. Then you would have caught Mrs. Marten, as the
boat arrives here at a quarter of four in the morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Willard wanted badly to swear at the well-meaning
butler. He had chosen the train purposely in order
to be in Newport the previous night, and his own haste
had proved his undoing. Why should this fat menial
put an unerring finger on the one weak spot in his
calculations?</p>

<p>But he felt the urgent need for action, and he was
only losing time now, as it was evident that Nancy had
covered her tracks dexterously where her servants were
concerned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that cab still waiting?&rdquo; he demanded suddenly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir. I didn&rsquo;t notice any baggage. Shall
I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t intend to remain. I&rsquo;ll telegraph to New
York, and go there by tonight&rsquo;s steamer. Meanwhile,
I have some friends at the Ocean House whom I would
like to look up. By the way, don&rsquo;t mention to anyone
that I am upset by my daughter&rsquo;s absence. It might
come to Mrs. Marten&rsquo;s ears, and she would be unnec<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>essarily
worried. My heart is slightly affected&mdash;you
understand?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The butler understood perfectly. He could be
trusted not to cause Mrs. Marten any uneasiness.</p>

<p>Then Willard set out on the trail of the runaways,
following it with a grim purpose not to be balked by
repeated failure. At the station he had little difficulty
in learning that a lady and gentleman&mdash;lady young
and good-looking, gentleman who walked with a limp&mdash;had
taken tickets for Boston. He was in Boston
within three hours; but Power had broken the line
there to such good purpose that the scent failed, for
he had caused Nancy to go alone on a shopping expedition,
and purchase her own ticket for Burlington, and,
when he joined her in a parlor car, the fact that they
were traveling in company was by no means published
to all the world.</p>

<p>So Willard returned to Newport, removed his baggage
from the Ocean House&mdash;for some inscrutable reason
he distrusted Dacre&rsquo;s smiling <i>bonhomie</i>&mdash;and occupied
quarters in a less important hotel. Changing
his name, by the simple expedient of ordering a supply
of visiting cards, he called on the horse-breeding
judge, who could facilitate his seemingly eager quest
for Power only by telling him to send a letter to the
care of a New York bank. This was something gained,
and he hurried to New York, where, of course, he was
suavely directed to write, and the letter would be
forwarded.</p>

<p>Driven to his wits&rsquo; end after a week of furtive visits
to restaurants, on the off chance that the fugitives
might really be in the metropolitan city, he employed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
a private inquiry agent, and, five days later, received
the first definite news. A &ldquo;Mr. and Mrs. Darien
Power&rdquo; had registered at the Lake Champlain Hotel
on the evening of the day of Nancy&rsquo;s flight, and had
gone into the Adirondacks next morning!</p>

<p>On the principle that it never rains but it pours,
quick on the heels of this startling intelligence came
a letter from Nancy. It had been sent to Denver, and
some bungle in readdressing it had caused a prolonged
delay. It was brief and to the point, and had been
posted at Boston.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;My dear Father [she wrote].&mdash;It will cause you much
distress, but not any real surprise, to hear that I have
decided to dissolve my marriage with Mr. Marten. I have
met Derry Power, and now I know just what happened at
Bison when you forced me to marry a man whom I detested.
I forgive you your share in that horrible deceit;
but I cannot forgive Marten, and the action I am taking
renders it impossible that he and I should ever meet again.
You will learn the why and the wherefore in due course.
Meanwhile, I hope you will not take this thing too deeply
to heart, and I look forward to our reunion in more peaceful
days. When the divorce proceedings are ended, and
Derry and I are married, I shall tell you where to find
me. By that time, perhaps, you will have decided to accept
the inevitable, and let the past be forgotten. I am
well, and happy&mdash;very, very happy.</p>

<p class="ralign">
<span style="margin-right: 2em;">&ldquo;Your loving,</span><br />
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Nancy</span>.&rdquo;<br />
</p></div>

<p>Willard brooded long over this straightforward
message. He was blind and deaf to its gentle reproach,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
finding in it only a confirmation of his worst fears.
There was no need now to map out a course of action;
he had limned that in the main before leaving Newport.
Vengeance on Power, vengeance ample and complete,
was what he craved for. He understood, in
some furtive and perverted way, that he could not strike
a mortal blow at a man of Power&rsquo;s temperament by
using the bludgeons of the law to expiate an offense
against society. Both Nancy and her lover must have
discounted the effect of the social pillory before they
transgressed its code beyond redemption. Indeed, they
would hail with joy the edict which banned them&mdash;be
it proclaimed from the housetops and carried round
the earth by the myriad-tongued press! Nancy&rsquo;s letter,
too, showed that she would not scruple to make
known her defense, and Willard was well aware that
it would serve to rehabilitate her in the eyes of her
friends.</p>

<p>So he had devised a ghoulish and crafty punishment,
which, the more he pondered it, the more subtle and
effective did it appear. As the scheme grew in his
imagination, he almost hugged himself in rapturous
approval of it. So warped was his mind that he
might have discovered, were he capable of making an
honest analysis of motives, that he was actually gloating
over the position in which his daughter was placed
if only because of the weapon it placed in his hands
against Power.</p>

<p>To succeed, two conditions were necessary&mdash;Power
must not have written to his mother, nor Nancy to
her husband. To his thinking, neither of these eventualities
was likely. The very environment of the woods<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
and lakes of the Adirondacks forbade the notion. If
he was right, he would turn Power&rsquo;s dream of happiness
into bitterest gall; if wrong, there was still another
alternative, deadlier, more lurid, but far from
being so attractive to a mean and rather cowardly nature.
Time alone would show which project promised
success&mdash;to fail in both was nearly, if not quite, impossible.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, no painted Indian ever camped on the
trail of unsuspecting pioneer with more malign intent
and rancorous tenacity than Willard displayed in his
pursuit and tracking of the erring pair. He was not
a righteously incensed father, but a disappointed man
who saw within his grasp the means of glutting the
stored malice of years. To appreciate to the full
Willard&rsquo;s mental processes at this period of his life,
not only his double-dealing in the matter of Nancy&rsquo;s
marriage, but his vain longings for the lost wealth of
the Dolores Ranch, must be taken into account. Even
then, his apologist might plead an obsession mounting
almost to insanity. Nothing else would explain
his actions; but no words could palliate them, for the
ruthless Pawnee he resembled would assuredly have
chosen a less ignoble revenge.</p>

<h2><small>CHAPTER X</small><br />

NANCY DECIDES</h2>


<p>A long spur of the Adirondack Mountains
stretches across Hamilton County from northeast to
southwest. In a hollow on the western slopes of the
range nestles Forked Lake. Some five or six miles
nearer the watershed, and some hundreds of feet higher
in altitude, lies a smaller and prettier lake, difficult
of access, and far from the beaten track of tourists.
Hither, by devious paths, Power had brought Nancy.
A guide, hired at Elizabethtown, was enthusiastic about
the fishing in that particular sheet of water, and he
vouched for it that there was quarry in plenty for
gun as well as rod; moreover, attracted by the sport
and scenery, he had built a hut on the unfrequented side
of the lake, in which were stored a sufficiency of rough
furniture, some cooking utensils, and a canoe. Given
fine weather and good health, what more did anyone
want?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let us go there at once, Derry,&rdquo; said Nancy. &ldquo;A
cabin among trees on the shore of a lake has always
been my dream.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It sounds almost too idyllic,&rdquo; said Power, trying
to be cynical; &ldquo;but we&rsquo;ll hire the outfit for a week,
and move on to the next caravan in a day if we don&rsquo;t
like it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They arrived at night, in a drenching downpour<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
of rain, the outcome of the first and only thunderstorm
of the season, and were inclined consequently
to view with critical eyes the accommodation at their
disposal. The owner of the property, who also owned
a peculiar name, Peter Granite, had gone to a wood
hutch for dry fuel, and Power divested Nancy of a
dripping waterproof; while Peter&rsquo;s dog, a nondescript
of the hound type, known as &ldquo;Guess,&rdquo; shook his shaggy
fur noisily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Peter&rsquo; and &lsquo;Granite&rsquo; each signifies &lsquo;rock,&rsquo;&rdquo; he
whispered; &ldquo;but Guess seems to be of opinion that we
are stranded in a swamp.&rdquo; Incidentally, he kissed her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hush! I have faith in Peter. He told me today
that some famous author came here every summer till
he died; so the place must have a charm of its own.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps the famous author was a detached soul;
in other words, a queer fish.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And perhaps you&rsquo;ll get that wet coat off, and
make yourself useful. Please strike a match. If it
were not for Guess, I should be sure that something was
going to leap out of the dark and grab me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Nancy was admittedly a trifle nervous; but the
feeling passed at once when Granite had a fire roaring
in a stove, and an oil lamp was swinging from a
hook, and the cabin was filled with warmth, and the
grateful scent of a stew mixed with the steam of drying
dog and garments. The sleeping arrangements
were so primitive, however, that Nancy dared not undress.
Every inch of the tiny bedroom was lit by
lightning almost incessantly, and the constant dripping
of water from the roof, added to the howling and
whistling of the wind, kept her and Power awake till<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
long after midnight. They would have risen and gone
back to the more comfortable living-room, where the
stove might have induced drowsiness, and Power could
smoke, at least, but certain regular sounds from that
quarter revealed that Granite cared little for the storm,
was even expressing his unconscious contempt for it
audibly; while Guess had met some lifelong foe in his
dreams and was fighting a Homeric battle.</p>

<p>To while away the slow-moving hours, and perchance
close their senses to the external uproar, the lovers
talked, or, rather, Nancy talked and Power listened.
A casual reference to some such wild night in France
led the girl to discourse of her Parisian friends, and
she gave full play to a ready wit and gift of close yet
kindly and humorous observation which, in different
conditions, would certainly have won her a place among
contemporary writers on French life and manners.
American ways and habits of thought owe so much
to the Gallic leaven introduced at the beginning of the
eighteenth century that a modern American woman assimilates
French ideas with more ease and surer touch
than her British sister; so Nancy would have brought
to the task both racial sympathy and natural equipment.
She knew Daudet and Turgenieff&mdash;had been
present at one of their famous quarrels&mdash;and her description
of the Russian&rsquo;s unbridled fury and the
Frenchman&rsquo;s ironic good temper caused the scene to
live again. She spoke French fluently, had even
gleaned some scraps of Russian, and Power found himself
transported in imagination to the brilliant salons
where litterateurs like Zola and Copp&eacute;e bickered, where
artists like Rodin and Bonnat founded schools, where<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
Massenet played snatches of operas yet to reach the
ear of a wider world, where the men and women who
occupied the stage in the Dreyfus drama were already
stabbing reputations with poison-tipped epigrams.</p>

<p>Often she brought laughter to his lips; as, for instance,
when she spoke of the beautiful and fascinating
wife of a struggling artist, a lady notorious in
many walks of life, who attended a fancy-dress ball
at the American Embassy. &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said someone to
the Duchesse de Brasnes, &ldquo;here comes the latest star,
gotten up appropriately as Madame R&eacute;camier!&rdquo;
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; chirped the witty old lady instantly. &ldquo;You
have given her the wrong name. You mean Madame
R&eacute;cl&acirc;mier!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Luckily, Power&rsquo;s acquaintance with the French language
was close enough to enable him to appreciate
the caustic humor of the words. He was far too absorbed
then in the girl&rsquo;s vivid impressions of personalities
familiar to him only in the columns of newspapers
to indulge in speculation as to the why and the wherefore
of this flow of anecdote and quaintly analytical
glimpses of character. But he understood later.
During three long years she had existed in an atmosphere
that checked every natural impulse. She had
become a statue, beautiful but impassive. Now she
was once more a woman. The marble was coming
to life. Love had breathed on her, and the red blood
was flowing freely in her veins.</p>

<p>He could have listened till dawn; but the sweet voice
suddenly grew husky, and she expressed a desire to
rest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Derry,&rdquo; she said, with the unthinking confidence<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
of a tired child, &ldquo;let me lean my head on your shoulder.
With your arm around me, I do believe I can
forget even this dreadful lightning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Within a minute she was asleep. She merely smiled
and murmured something about &ldquo;putting the light
out&rdquo; when he laid her gently in a roughly carpentered
but fairly comfortable bunk, and covered her with a
rug. Then he, too, after a brief vigil to assure himself
that she would not waken, stretched himself in
the second bunk.</p>

<p>When next they opened their eyes the sun was shining
from a cloudless sky, and Peter was shouting that they
just had time to dip their hands and faces in the lake
before the &ldquo;cawfee kem to a bile.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They were out in a jiffy, and found themselves in
a fairyland. On the one hand, green and blue mountains
rose in an almost unscalable rampart; on the
other, across two miles of a silvery mirror ordinarily
a lake, a wooded landscape fell away in gorgeous tints
and ineffable distances. The song of birds trilled in
the air, and the fresh, keen scent of the rain-washed
pines was pungent in their nostrils. After one delighted
glance at this circumambient Paradise, they
raced to the water, and, as they ran, Nancy noticed
the phenomenally clean-cut reflection of the opposite
shore.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Derry,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;just look at that picture!
Can you wonder if I hardly know whether I am standing
on my head or my heels?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perhaps, of all the tender memories which Power
has hoarded through the years, he is most tenacious
of his recollection of Nancy as she was that morning.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
She seemed some wood-nymph clothed in the garments
of civilization, that modern cult which the Greeks,
those true poets and clear thinkers, would have scoffed
at. Yet, so graceful were her movements, so bewitching
her mobile face, so artistic the careless knot into
which she had twisted her wealth of nut-brown hair,
that not even the Boston tailor of a bygone generation
who had equipped her at sight with a fawn-colored
coat and skirt could hide the symmetry of her form
or impair her winsome beauty.</p>

<p>The lake was oval in shape, and an imaginary line
drawn from shore to shore at its center would measure
more than a mile. The hut stood half a mile
north of the eastern end of this line, and a summer
hotel, patronized mostly by zealots of rod and hook,
lay half a mile south of it on the opposite side. Thus,
except on the rare occasions when a fishing canoe came
that way&mdash;and the water was so alive with fish that
the requisite paddling meant so much wasted time and
effort&mdash;they were absolutely shut off from the world.
Even while they were scampering to the spot where
they had landed the night before, Power was noting
a tree-shrouded creek where a tiny stream from the
hills babbled the last of its brief life into the placid
bosom of the lake. There, he decided, it would be
easy to contrive an admirable bathing-place for Nancy,
as she was only a timid swimmer, having acquired the
art quite recently. He himself was equally at home
in sea, river, and lake. On one occasion, during his
engineering novitiate, he had swum across the Arkansas
River when it was almost at flood level, and it needs
those who have seen and heard that turbulent stream<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
roaring through its rocky canyons between Pueblo and
Las Animas to appreciate the feat at its true worth.</p>

<p>Then he would teach her how to fish and shoot;
for they must be self-supporting to a large extent,
though the hotel provided a well-equipped base for this
foray into the wilds of the Adirondacks. Yes, they
would have a glorious time, living like Indians, yet tempering
their savagery by the sweet communion of kindred
souls, with never a newspaper nearer than the
hotel, their address a tangle of wooded mountains, and
their solitary book a copy of Milton&rsquo;s poems, which,
Nancy had said once in Newport, she had never appreciated
properly, and which Power, an enthusiast,
had recommended to her close study as the well of
English, pure and undefiled.</p>

<p>Nor was their earliest day-dream any fantasy, or
other than a superficial glimpse of delights which expanded
hourly before their enraptured vision. A whole
fortnight slipped away so rapidly in this Elysium that
Nancy, keeping a housewifely eye on stores, discovered
the flight of time only by the urgent need of replenishing
a cupboard bare of coffee, and sugar, and
bacon, and other essentials, notably matches; for the
summer camp has yet to be built in which the supply
of matches has endured to the end.</p>

<p>Usually, when a visit to the hotel became necessary,
Peter Granite took the canoe, while Derry and Nancy,
escorted by Guess, rambled off for the day into the
hills behind the hut. They had no fear of getting
lost, because Power was endowed with a sixth sense
in all matters pertaining to topography, while the
dog was credited by his master with an infallible knowl<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>edge
of the homeward way at dinnertime. But on
this day, by unhappy chance, Nancy announced that
she wanted the cabin clear of men while she indulged
in a feminine foible, common to all her sex, known as
spring cleaning. Season or clime is immaterial; when
that microbe seizes a woman she has to undergo the
disease from the earliest symptoms to complete convalescence.
The premonitory signs are unmistakable.
She begins by a ruthless survey of corners, floors,
spidery rafters, and grimy windows. Her eyes sparkle,
she turns up the sleeves of her blouse, dons an
apron, and arranges for unlimited quantities of hot
water and soap. Nancy possessed no apron; but a
square of sacking and some cord soon settled that
difficulty.</p>

<p>Therefore, deeming themselves wise, Derry and Peter
fled, leaving the dog and a double-barreled shotgun as
safeguards. Not that any sort of protection was
needed in that favored region. The predatory tramp
cannot exist there; the inhabitants are the most courteous
and law-abiding people in America; the only
strangers are city holiday-makers of the quiet and
cultured type.</p>

<p>The men promised to remain away two hours. Considering
the time altogether too short for the thorough
cleansing of the hut, Nancy set to work with a will,
and when first she thought of glancing at her watch
she found that one hour had sped already. Guess was
sitting in the sun, blinking lazily at a beetle which
had been disturbed, and was now scuttling away for
dear life. Possibly the dog was wondering why uneasy
mortals should not rest when not hunting; but, de<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>spite
his canine philosophy, he was keeping watch and
ward with due vigilance, for he rose suddenly, and
growled.</p>

<p>Nancy knew that he hardly ever barked; but his
growl was an unfailing indication of the near presence
of some intruder; whether man or animal remained
to be seen. An occasional wolf, and a species of small
black bear&mdash;the latter very scarce&mdash;were the only dangerous
creatures which could possibly come near the
cabin, and then only by accident; so Nancy was merely
obeying Peter&rsquo;s behests in picking up the gun, and
making sure that both barrels were loaded, before going
to investigate the cause of the dog&rsquo;s uneasiness.
Out of the tail of her eye she noted that he had stalked
away deliberately toward the back of the cabin. Whatever
it was that had disturbed his siesta, he was still
bidding it defiance; so she hurried somewhat, and, the
morning sun being in her eyes, saw, without instant
recognition, a man of small stature standing motionless
some yards away among the undergrowth.</p>

<p>Then a well-remembered voice chilled her heart with
terror; for her father cried angrily:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Call that brute off! He looks like flying at my
throat!&rdquo;</p>

<p>During a few seconds of icy fear and foreboding she
could neither move nor speak. The dog, quick to learn
that this stranger was unwelcome, snarled with louder
menace, and the fur rose along his spine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you hear?&rdquo; shouted Willard, now thoroughly
alarmed. &ldquo;Do you want me to shoot him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Down, Guess!&rdquo; she contrived to say, in a queer
falsetto; for her tongue seemed palsied, and her throat<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
had gone dry. But the mechanical effort at speech
served to restore her faculties, and she continued more
naturally:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You startled both Guess and myself, Father. The
dog will not hurt you. Use his name&mdash;Guess. Then
he will wag his tail and make friends.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Guess, however, belied this good character. He allowed
Willard to approach; but eyed him with covert
suspicion. In her panic of distress and apprehension
the girl had forgotten that her father was one of
that small company of human beings who dislike dogs,
and whose antipathy is returned in double measure by
the animal which, above all others, is regarded as the
friend of man. Still, Guess obeyed orders, with reservations,
and contented himself by displaying an alert
watchfulness widely at variance with his earlier state
of dignified repose.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course, you know why I am here?&rdquo; began Willard,
smiling complacently. Nancy&rsquo;s evident agitation
put him at once in a superior position, and his
mean soul rejoiced in the fact; for it was he who should
be afraid, and not his daughter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she faltered, turning her frightened eyes toward
the lake.</p>

<p>Oh, if Derry would only come back sooner than he
had promised! She half formed a desperate resolve
to fire both barrels of the gun, and thus summon
him with all speed, because the reports would be
heard easily across that mile and a half of placid
water.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come to take you away,&rdquo; said the harsh voice
at her shoulder. &ldquo;I got your letter, and managed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
to find out where you were hiding. Now you must come
with me, straight away, do you understand?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The sheer absurdity of his querulous words helped
to stem the rising flood of agony which threatened to
overwhelm her; for at that moment she was nearer
to fainting than she had ever been before.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You had better have stayed away than come here
in anger and ask a thing that is impossible,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Impossible! Nothing is impossible&mdash;to a woman.
Your husband knows nothing of your conduct. No
one in the world knows, except myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>If Nancy were not quite distraught and bereft of
her quick intelligence, she would have detected a note
of breathless questioning and doubt in that confident
assertion. Willard could not be certain that neither
she nor Power had written to Marten; he had staked
all, or nearly all, on ascertaining the fact during the
first outburst of talk, while the girl was still quaking
with fright at his unexpected appearance. He was
well aware of her courage and adroitness. When she
regained self-control&mdash;a matter of a minute or less&mdash;she
might be clear-sighted enough to grasp the paramount
importance of the admission that she had not
as yet placed an insuperable barrier between herself
and the man she had cast off. Once alive to its vital
significance, he thought, she would either deceive him
deliberately, and take the earliest opportunity of rectifying
an error in strategy, or, at any rate, keep him
in ignorance of the exact position of affairs. Unhappily,
he counted well. Nancy was far too dismayed
by his presence to pay heed to tricks and turns of
speech.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Father,&rdquo; she said brokenly, &ldquo;I have so much to
endure that you, for one, should spare me your
taunts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not taunting you,&rdquo; he urged. &ldquo;I want to
save you from yourself. By a stroke of good luck I
was able to make it appear that you and I missed each
other in Newport, owing to a railroad accident. Your
friends on the island believe you are with me in New
York. If we were to arrive at Newport tomorrow, not
a living soul, except me, would know what has happened.
I shall be dumb, you may well believe, and I
suppose your&mdash;this fellow Power&mdash;will hold his tongue?
Surely he is man enough for that!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Beneath the brown of sun and air, Nancy&rsquo;s forehead
and cheeks had assumed the pallor of <i>cama&iuml;eu
gris</i>, that wan tint with which the monkish illuminators
of missals were wont to depict the sufferings of martyrs;
but they now flushed with the red stain of unflinching
resolve, for her father&rsquo;s loathsome suggestions
aroused all that was high-minded and virile in her
character.</p>

<p>She withdrew a pace, and threw the gun across her
body as though to protect herself from an assassin&rsquo;s
knife.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How can you so demean yourself?&rdquo; she cried hysterically.
&ldquo;Go away, and never let us meet again until
you have taught yourself to think decently! Return
to Hugh Marten now? Leave the man I love,
and act the part of a faithful wife to one whom I hate?
Even Marten, bad as he is, would shudder at the
thought if he could hear you utter it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Willard smiled again in ghastly humor. At least,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
there was one obstacle the less. She had not written!
But his ill-timed mirth changed quickly to a snarl;
for Guess had interpreted this angry scene in his own
way, and was ready to begin a fray already postponed
unduly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you beat off this damned dog?&rdquo; came the
cry. &ldquo;Let us go into the house, and tell the cur to
stop outside.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Once again was Nancy prompted to fire the signal
that would bring Power in hot haste to her side; but
she repressed the notion, deeming herself calmer now,
more assured, more confident in the justice of her cause
and her ability to set it forth convincingly. Indeed,
her bewildered brain was actively at work already devising
means whereby Derry and her father should
be kept apart. She did not want them to quarrel beyond
redemption. Time, she hoped and believed, would
assuage present bitterness, and, if the gods were kind,
the coming years might find the older man in a mood
to yield to other claims on his forgiveness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lie down, Guess!&rdquo; she said, patting the dog&rsquo;s head.
&ldquo;Just curl up there in the sun. Yes, that&rsquo;s a dear!
Lie down!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Guess did not curl up; but stretched himself on the
grass in front of the door, resting his head between
his paws, and keeping a pair of particularly bright
eyes fixed on Willard. He would have treated a tame
snake or a performing bear in much the same way, if
so bidden by someone whom he trusted.</p>

<p>Father and daughter entered the cabin, which was
all of a jumble owing to the cleansing operations.
Nancy unloaded the gun&mdash;why, she hardly knew, be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>cause
that was the first thing Derry would attend to
when he returned. Placing the weapon on the table,
she essayed a forlorn smile at the disorder the place
was in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Derry and Peter have gone to the hotel for stores,&rdquo;
she said, &ldquo;and I took the opportunity to tidy our small
castle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I saw them crossing the lake,&rdquo; said Willard. &ldquo;I
have been waiting two days for the chance that offered
this morning. You see, Nancy, you and I had to thresh
out matters between our two selves. When all is said
and done, the future concerns us far more than any
other person.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nancy looked across the lake. There was no sign
of the canoe, and she was glad of it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Dad,&rdquo; she said, tuning her utterance to a
softer key in valiant endeavor to place their relations
on a friendly footing, &ldquo;I hope you will try and think
less harshly of Derry and me. What is done cannot
be undone&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It can be put straight, which is the next best
thing,&rdquo; broke in Willard fiercely. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not here to
listen to <i>your</i> plans; but you must listen to <i>mine</i>! I
have no time to lose, nor have you; so I&rsquo;ll put my meaning
in the plainest words possible, and I&rsquo;ll thank you
not to interrupt me. I&rsquo;m not going to lecture you on
morality, and that sort of thing&mdash;that&rsquo;s not my business.
I have followed you with one object, and one
only, and that is to take you back to your husband.
Don&rsquo;t try to shut me up!&rdquo; he almost screamed; for
Nancy&rsquo;s indignation had crimsoned her face and neck
again. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got to hear what I have to say,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
and it must be here and now. You&rsquo;ll know why when
I have finished. I&rsquo;ve thought this wretched affair
through from A to Z, and <i>my</i> way has to be <i>your</i> way&mdash;unless
you prefer the alternative. You either come
with me now, this instant, and promise not to leave
me until I hand you over to your husband, or I shall
shoot Power at sight. That is my offer. Take it or
leave it. I give you your fancy man&rsquo;s life in exchange
for your obedience. Refuse, and I fill him full of lead.
I&rsquo;m running no bluff on you. I mean just what I am
saying. I am not even taking any great risk, because
there isn&rsquo;t a jury in America that would convict a father
for killing the man who betrayed his daughter
while her husband&rsquo;s back was turned. The dirty hound!
I&rsquo;ve got both him and you in a tight place, and now
you&rsquo;re going to suffer, each of you. Condemn him
to death if you like. I don&rsquo;t care a red cent which
way your choice goes. But, if you want him to live,
you must return to Marten, and be his good and
loving wife once more. No, you gain nothing by
shrinking away in horror at the notion. Nor will
death serve your ends, since a silly woman would think
little of giving her life to save her lover. You have
my full and complete terms, no less, in exchange for
Power&rsquo;s life. It won&rsquo;t save him if you agree to come
away with me and throw yourself overboard before our
steamer reaches Europe. That will mean simply that
I take the next boat west, and kill Power. My plea
still holds good. I am prepared to face any court with
the proofs of my story. But I can&rsquo;t waste any more
time. Which is it to be&mdash;go or stay&mdash;give Power his
life or take it? If you want to please me, which is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
about the last thing you would think of, refuse to
come with me, because I am aching to empty these into
his rotten carcass.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nancy had shrunk from his growing frenzy no less
than from his monstrous decree; but her dilated eyes
were fixed on his, utterly regardless of the brace of
heavy-caliber revolvers he had produced, apparently to
lend a theatrical effect to his words. In truth, the man
had no such thought in his mind. He was beyond the
reach of any impulse of that sort. His maniacal fury
was real enough to convince the most skeptical that he
fully intended every word of that murderous threat.
Nor did the distracted girl harbor any doubt on that
score. Suddenly, awfully, she had been scourged to the
verge of a precipice, and it was borne in on her she
had no option but to make the heartrending decision
which the man whom she had once loved as a father
was forcing on her.</p>

<p>Her very lips blanched, and she gazed at Willard
with all the hatred and passionate scorn of a
woman wronged beyond redress.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&mdash;you&mdash;&rdquo; she gasped incoherently, &ldquo;you are
not God! It is God alone who wields such power
over men and women. He, and He only, may pronounce
a decree of life or death against those who
have sinned&mdash;not you, a man who sold his own daughter
for money!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Power told you that, did he? The story came well
from the mouth of the cheat who robbed me of my
property.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But that is a lie. Why demean yourself by uttering
such a plea?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We can argue the rights and wrongs of the matter
some other time. Are you coming with me, or
not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, a thousand times no!&rdquo; she almost shrieked.</p>

<p>Willard repocketed the pistols, and turned to leave
the hut. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right!&rdquo; he chuckled sardonically.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d as soon have it that way as the other.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nancy was quite beside herself with agony, or she
would never have snatched up the gun and held it
pointblank at his back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; she screamed. &ldquo;Stop, or I vow to Heaven
I&rsquo;ll fire!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He faced her again, and his frenzy was comparable
only with that of the distracted girl who threatened
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you want to shoot me you must reload your
gun,&rdquo; he said, and his face grew livid, though not with
fright. &ldquo;Do you imagine that an old man like me
fears death? Shoot, I tell you, and see if my last
curse does not part you and Power. Test his love
by telling him you are a murderess&mdash;that you have
killed your own father. Ask him to help in hiding my
body, and then cower in hourly terror, both of you,
till a New York bank sends to my lawyer the letter
I have left in its charge. Shoot me now, and I&rsquo;ll die
happy in the knowledge that Power and you will be
tried for my murder.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She dropped the gun, and burst into a tempest of
weeping; but her tears seemed but to harden Willard
into an even more callous and determined mood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you forget that I am watching for the coming
of that canoe,&rdquo; he said, sinking his voice to a note<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
of sinister meaning. &ldquo;If Power and I meet, nothing
that you can do will save him. It is possible, of
course, that he may avoid me this time. You can
scream a warning, and he may, or may not, skulk off
out of range. But, as sure as there is a sun shining
in the sky, so surely will I follow and kill him. Each
moment you hesitate brings him nearer the grave. You
can save him, if you like; but you must buy his life
on my terms, now. It will be too late in a few
minutes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She threw herself on her knees, and raised her swimming
eyes in humblest pleading.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Father, think what you are doing!&rdquo; she sobbed,
clutching at his hands in a heartbroken way. &ldquo;I am
your own little daughter, the girl you used to be so
proud of, the girl who once loved you dearly, and who
is ready to forget the past and love you again. You
would not condemn me to the degraded life of a woman
who loathes and has been unfaithful to her husband, and
yet permits him to regard her as his wife? I may be
the meanest of God&rsquo;s creatures in your sight; but you
are asking me to act as no decent-minded woman can
act, and live. Ah, no! Do not speak yet! Listen,
I implore you! God give me words to touch your
heart! Have you blotted from your mind all recollection
of our long years together on the ranch? Does
it count for nothing that I rejoiced with you when
times were good, and sorrowed with you when misfortunes
came? Have you forgotten my mother? Ah,
dear Heaven, my mother! You loved her, did you not?
You have said you loved me, not alone for my own
sake, but because I reminded you of her. She, at least,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
was good and pure, and perhaps her spirit is with
us now, grieving for my sin, it may be, but surely not
content with the dreadful lot you would impose on
one who is your child and hers. Oh, father dear,
do not turn away from me! Is there nothing I can
promise that will soften your heart? I will leave
Derry. Yes, I swear it! To save him, and you, I&rsquo;ll
go away and never see him again, writing him some
cruel lie in order to assuage his misery; but you shall
not, you must not, make my return to Hugh Marten the
price of my obedience to your will!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Willard wrenched himself free, and took a sheet of
notepaper, an envelop, and a pencil from a pocket.
He placed them on the rough table, and stood in the
doorway, watching the sunlit lake. His expression was
dour, implacable, malignant in its ferocious joy; for
he held Power in the hollow of his hand, and would
relinquish naught of his vengeful scheme.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to see you are convinced that I mean what
I have said,&rdquo; he announced, speaking in a cold, balanced
way that Nancy knew of old, and recognized now
as sounding the knell of her hopes. &ldquo;Unless I am mistaken,
the canoe is putting off from the hotel. It will
be here in twenty minutes. You have just five minutes
to make up your mind, and to write a farewell
message to Power. I don&rsquo;t care what you say to him,
so long as the break is final. You are going with me
to Newport, and straight from there to London, where
Marten will join us in response to a cablegram from
me, telling him that you are ill. You had better stop
crying. Nothing that you can say or do, short of
loading that gun again and blowing a hole in me, will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
change either my purpose or my terms. I&rsquo;ll keep my
word with regard to Power if you keep yours where
Marten is concerned. He must never know. He must
never see any change in you. The moment he casts
you off because of Power, and I am still alive, you sign
Power&rsquo;s death-warrant.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nancy rose. She was deathly white, and the tears
still coursed silently down her cheeks; but despair had
benumbed her emotions, and she spoke calmly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are sentencing me to death,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Am I? Then Power dies, too,&rdquo; he cried.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. That is not in the bond. You stipulate that
I shall return to Marten as his wife, and that I am
not to take my own life. But if my heart breaks, and
I die, you will have glutted your bitter malice already,
and Derry, too, must not provide you with a victim.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;People don&rsquo;t die of broken hearts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Every woman who has loved will think differently.
But you have some notion of what is meant by honor,
I suppose? I demand your promise that if I accompany
you now, and go back to Marten, and never attempt
to meet Derry again&mdash;though that would be
quite impossible, either for him or for me&mdash;you withdraw
your threat, and leave him in peace during the
remainder of your life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not here to receive terms, but to state them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then he and I will fall together beneath your bullets.
Before you shoot him, you will have to shoot
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well, then. I agree. I don&rsquo;t want to kill my
own daughter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have done that already. You have slain her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
soul, and her poor body is of slight importance. Ah,
may Heaven forgive me if I am not choosing aright!
Derry, my own dear love, you must never know that
I am doing this for your sake, or it will not be the
wretch whom once I called father who becomes judge
and jury and executioner in my behalf!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Willard, still turned toward the lake, heard her drop
on her knees again beside the table. She wrote a few
words, very few; for her dazed brain was incapable now
of framing other than the simplest sentences. Then
she sealed the envelop, and kissed it, and went out.
Brushing the tears from her eyes, she gave one long
look across the shimmering water, and saw a black dot
which she knew was the canoe heading straight for the
cabin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, dear God!&rdquo; she sighed, pressing her clenched
hands to her breast.</p>

<p>The storm passed as quickly as it had arisen. She
stooped, patted the dog, and bade him remain there
on guard. Then, without ever a glance at Willard, she
said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have made my choice. I am ready!&rdquo;</p>

<h2><small>CHAPTER XI</small><br />

POWER&rsquo;S HOME-COMING</h2>


<p>It chanced that Peter Granite occupied the fore part
of the canoe; consequently, great as was the distance,
he saw Willard and Nancy leaving the hut and disappearing
among the trees. He tossed a question over
his shoulder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You hain&rsquo;t been expectin&rsquo; anyone, hev you?&rdquo; he
demanded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a sort o&rsquo; notion Mrs. Power has just quit,
with a man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yep.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Someone must have happened on the cabin. Perhaps
she is showing him the road to the divide. Was
the dog with her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hain&rsquo;t seen Guess; but a mile an&rsquo; a half across
this yer shinin&rsquo; water is a long ways ter spot a dawg.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, there&rsquo;s nothing to worry about. We don&rsquo;t
quite own the earth; though one might come to think
along that line after living here a spell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nothing more was said; but both men plied their
paddles with strong, sweeping strokes that drove the
canoe onward at a rare pace. When she grounded,
Power sprang ashore, and did not wait, as was his wont,
to help with the packages. Already he felt anxious,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
because Nancy had not appeared in or about the hut,
and the dog was now plainly visible, lying in front
of the open door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nancy!&rdquo; he shouted.</p>

<p>There was no answer; but Guess rose, yawned, and
stretched his limbs, his vigil being ended. Power
shouted again, more loudly, and Granite, having drawn
the canoe high and dry, joined him, leaving the unloading
of the provisions until a less troubled moment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t jest like Mrs. Power not ter be within
hail,&rdquo; said the guide. &ldquo;Hurry up to the shack, Mr.
Power, an&rsquo; put Guess on her trail if she ain&rsquo;t havin&rsquo; a
snooze in the back room.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She wouldn&rsquo;t be asleep at this hour. And you saw
her, you said?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I might ha been mistook. My eyes ain&rsquo;t so good
as they was.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Power broke into a run, and Granite followed slowly,
those keen eyes of his, which ill-deserved the charge he
had levied against them, searching the trees and the
broken ground behind the hut for some sign of the two
people whom he had undoubtedly observed.</p>

<p>With one last cry of &ldquo;Nancy!&rdquo; Power hurried past
the dog, who was greeting him with tail-wagging and
a rumbling growl which meant, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;ve come
back, but why didn&rsquo;t you come sooner?&rdquo; He peered
through the doorway into the room beyond, and his
glance fell on the note, resting on the table beside the
gun.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; he announced, in a tone of vast
relief. &ldquo;Someone has called her away, and here is the
explanation.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the dog was obviously inviting his master
to a scouting expedition among the trees and brushwood
to the left of the cabin&rsquo;s front, and Granite
was so puzzled by the animal&rsquo;s behavior that he paid
no heed to Power during the next few seconds; moreover,
the fact that Nancy had left a written message
showed that, although something unusual might have
occurred, it was not necessarily alarming. Then he
heard a queer sort of sob, or groan, and, glancing at
Power, saw that in his face which brought a dismayed
question to his own lips.</p>

<p>&ldquo;God A&rsquo;mighty, Mr. Power, what&rsquo;s got ye?&rdquo; he
cried.</p>

<p>Power made no reply. He seemed as though
stricken with a palsy. He absolutely reeled, and would
have tumbled headlong had he not, by chance, staggered
back against the jamb of the door. Granite
caught him by the arm lest he should fall, and Nancy&rsquo;s
letter dropped from his nerveless fingers, and fluttered
to the ground.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t give way like that,&rdquo; urged the guide.
&ldquo;She ain&rsquo;t dead, anyhow. Has she left you bad
news?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Power looked at the man as though he did not recognize
him. A baleful light gleamed in his eyes. Had
Willard been present then, it was not he who would
have been the slayer, unless he contrived to be extraordinarily
quick with his weapons.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She has gone,&rdquo; he said, in the monotone of tragedy;
for there are moments in life when the voice loses
its flexible notes, and mere speech becomes a mechanical
effort.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Gone?&rdquo; echoed Granite. &ldquo;Wall, I allow she&rsquo;ll come
back?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, she has left me forever. She says so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What, in that theer bit o&rsquo; writin&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Power, air you joshin&rsquo; me, er what?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Power drew a deep breath. The dizziness which had
benumbed his faculties was passing, and fortunately
so; for his sympathetic companion, despairing of obtaining
any lucid statement from this dazed man, was
stooping to pick up the letter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he managed to say. &ldquo;You must not read
that. It is meant for me alone. But give it to me.
I&mdash;I am afraid of falling. My head&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Vastly puzzled, the guide handed him the half-folded
sheet of paper. The bald explanation that Mrs. Power
had &ldquo;left&rdquo; her husband &ldquo;forever&rdquo; sounded like the
wildest variety of moon-madness. In Granite&rsquo;s own
phrase, he had never before clapped eyes on two sich
genuwine love-birds as Nancy and Derry, not in all his
born nateral, and to be told that one had deserted the
other merely went to prove that the speaker had gone
plumb crazy. For a time, indeed, he was convinced
that Power was suffering from a slight sunstroke, because
they had paddled nearly two miles while facing
the sun, whose rays were reflected in a glowing path
on the surface of the lake. Such attacks, though infrequent,
were not unknown in that high region. When
reaction set in, and Mrs. Power returned, the patient
would become violently sick, and a few hours of complete
rest would complete his cure.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jest go right inside an&rsquo; set yerself daown,&rdquo; he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
said cheerfully. &ldquo;Me an&rsquo; the dawg&rsquo;ll git on Madam&rsquo;s
trail in a brace o&rsquo; shakes. We&rsquo;ll bring her back, you
bet, an&rsquo; ef you kinder feel as though you&rsquo;d swallered
a live rabbit, wall, let it bolt!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Power uttered no protest. If he was capable of any
definite sensation, it was one of relief that the friendly
guide meant to leave him alone. He stumbled into
the hut, and collapsed on a chair, burying his face
in his hands. He heard Peter&rsquo;s lively command to
the dog, &ldquo;After her, Guess! Hark to it, Pup! Keep
yer nose to the ground, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll do the rest,&rdquo; as if the
man&rsquo;s voice and the eager whimpering of the hound
had traveled through a long tunnel before reaching
his ears. The sounds of the chase soon died away
among the trees. A great silence fell, and seemed to
wrap him in a pall that would never unfold again.
Fearing lest his brain might yield under the strain, he
spread the letter open on the table, and read it many
times. At first eyes and mind were equally incapable
of mastering its contents; but a subconscious knowledge
that he must either understand those vague words
or go mad in time enabled their sense to penetrate the
gathering mists.</p>

<p>And this is what he read:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;Derry, I am leaving you. Mr. Willard has followed
us. He is here with me now. He has forced me to believe
that duty demands my return to Hugh Marten; so I am
going. It is best so. Derry, don&rsquo;t grieve for me. If I
thought&mdash;&mdash;[these three words were canceled]. Derry,
forgive me. I can write no more. My poor heart is
breaking.</p>

<p class="ralign">
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Nancy.</span>&rdquo;<br />
</p></div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span></p>

<p>Slowly, through a haze of pain, certain incongruities
were revealed in the curt, disconnected sentences. Never
before, in all the years he had known her, had Nancy
alluded to her father as &ldquo;Mr. Willard.&rdquo; Even during
these later days, when the discovery of a parent&rsquo;s
treachery was a prime factor in her seemingly irrevocable
decision to dissolve her marriage, she spoke of
him invariably in terms of affection. Indeed, Power
had practised some measure of duplicity by pretending
to agree with her hopeful prophecy of a speedy reconciliation
between Willard and himself. He believed
he had summed up the man&rsquo;s character only too well.
Such a mean nature would assuredly remain stubborn
in its hostility; in fact, he was prepared to encounter
greater difficulties and annoyance from Willard than
from Marten, and meant to persuade Nancy to take
a world-tour of some years&rsquo; duration as soon as
the divorce was secured, and they were legally
married. Why, then, should it be &ldquo;Mr. Willard&rdquo;
who had followed them, and not &ldquo;my father,&rdquo; or
&ldquo;Dad&rdquo;?</p>

<p>And what an extraordinary plea she had put forward
to excuse her precipitate flight? &ldquo;He has forced
me to believe that duty demands my return to Hugh
Marten!&rdquo; When had woman ever convinced herself
more thoroughly than Nancy that &ldquo;duty&rdquo; did not
&ldquo;demand&rdquo; the sacrifice of her whole life? Had she
not weighed &ldquo;duty&rdquo; in the balance, and found it wanting,
before she cast all other considerations to the
winds, and fled from Newport with the man she loved?
But &ldquo;Mr. Willard&rdquo; had &ldquo;forced&rdquo; that view upon her.
Forced! A strange word! Had he threatened to mur<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>der
her? Had she written that letter at the dictation
of a maniac? Why, of course! The notion stung
Power to the quick, and he groaned aloud. How crass
and blind had been his anguished spirit when first it
quivered under the shock of her disappearance! How
much wiser and saner was Peter Granite! Even Guess,
the dog, read the riddle aright, and had urged instant
action. And how fortunate that these two faithful
friends had raced off in pursuit rather than wait at
the cabin until belated reason shed its light on the brain
of the one person in the world Nancy must have
trusted to understand her dilemma. At the thought
of his failure to grasp the essential elements of a
mystery that was simplicity itself when analyzed in
cold logic, the blood rushed through his veins like a
stream of molten metal, and he leaped to his feet,
all afire now to be up and doing. He ran out, and was
plunging wildly into the tangle of forest and scrub,
when it occurred to him that undirected search in that
wilderness was worse than useless. He was no Indian,
skilled in jungle lore, that he should discern the tracks
of pursued and pursuers, and follow them unerringly.
Better possess his soul in patience until some sight or
sound announced the return of Peter&mdash;with Nancy.
Oh, yes, Peter and the dog would soon overtake that
vengeful old man and his terrified victim! Pray
Heaven there might be no opportunity given Willard
to do evil to the girl who had thwarted his plans! Yet
how often had the chance to do ill deeds made ill deeds
done. Power wilted now under a horrible doubt which
brought fresh tortures. He listened for the distant
pistol-shot which might shatter his new-found hope.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
Perforce, he stilled his frenzy, and stood in anguished
silence.</p>

<p>But no sound of death-dealing weapon jarred on the
brooding solitude of that lake amid the hills; the
earliest intimation he received of the real nature of
his loss was when Granite and the dog came back&mdash;alone.</p>

<p>He strode a few paces to meet his allies, and in that
moment of black despair the pride of his manhood
sustained him, and choked the bitter words, the fierce
ravings, the storming of the very heavens, which tore
and raged for utterance, yet were so futile and helpless
in the one way that mattered&mdash;the rescue of his
lost love.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So, then, you could not overtake them?&rdquo; he said,
and, if Granite had not seen Power when the blow
fell, he would never have estimated the volcanic fury
of the furnace hidden under Power&rsquo;s unemotional voice
and manner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; came the quiet answer. &ldquo;Thar was
hosses in waitin&rsquo;, three hosses. They&rsquo;ve circled the head
of the lake, an&rsquo; I saw Mrs. Power&rsquo;s dress as they rode
away from the hotel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The perplexed guide deemed it best to blurt out the
actual facts. He thought, and rightly so, that any
attempt to minimize the full extent of the tragedy
would only add to Power&rsquo;s suffering when he knew the
truth. Nor was he comforted in the least by the unnatural
calm with which his news was received.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, look-a here, Mr. Power!&rdquo; he protested earnestly.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m ready to swear on the biggest Testament
ever prent that your good lady didn&rsquo;t vamoose of her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
own free will. Leave you? Gol-darn it, that&rsquo;s a bit too
rich fur me ter believe! Who&rsquo;s tuk her, anyhow? Why
did she go? What sort of a spiel did the cuss put up
that she walked off with him&mdash;when she had a gun, an&rsquo;
Guess was here, an&rsquo; she must ha seen you an&rsquo; me
comin&rsquo; in the canoe?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The man was her father. This quarrel is between
him and me. Peter, we must cross the lake at once.
We can hire horses at the hotel?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Granite shook his head sorrowfully. The affair was
beyond his comprehension; but it was his business to
undeceive his employer if he was counting on the chance
of overtaking the vanished pair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;This yer plot was well laid.
They run three nags at the hotel, an&rsquo; the hull blamed
bunch hit the pike fur Racket.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Racket was the nearest station, the terminus of a
short railway serving the Forked Lake district. It lay
six miles away! With the start Willard had secured,
he would be at the rail-head before the others had
crossed the lake. But Power knew he would go mad
if compelled to remain in the cabin when Nancy was
not there, and Granite made no further effort to detain
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll travel a heap quicker if we unload them
stores,&rdquo; was all he said, and Power turned instantly
to help in the work. When Peter had occasion to enter
the cabin, he examined the gun, and found the two
cartridges.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gosh!&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;She tuk &rsquo;em out herself. I
allow she didn&rsquo;t want ter shoot her own father; but
she must hev&rsquo; damn well felt like it!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then he eyed the dog.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wish you could talk, Pup,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Your long
lugs heerd what passed atween them two, an&rsquo; I guess
it kinder tried you good hard ter keep yer teeth outen
that old sinner&rsquo;s leg.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Power spoke no word until the canoe rested by the
side of the small landing-stage provided by the hotel.
Bidding the guide await his return, he hastened into
the building, and found the proprietor. Yes, a Mr.
Francis had registered two days ago. He had rented
a room overlooking the lake, and had hired the
hotel&rsquo;s three horses this morning. Two of the animals
were carrying him and a lady to Racket, and
the rider of the third was a groom, who had charge
of Mr. Francis&rsquo;s grip, and who would bring the nags
back from the depot. Mr. Francis seemed to be in
a desperate hurry; but that was not to be wondered at
if he meant to catch the next south-bound train, there
being just fifty minutes in which to cover the five miles.
There was no other train until the night mail, which
was due to leave Racket at seven o&rsquo;clock. The hotel
possessed a buggy; but Mr. Francis refused to use it.
In fact, he was willing to pay any price for the horses;
though it was most inconvenient that there should not
even be one horse left in the stable, as it might be
wanted in an emergency.</p>

<p>Power thanked his informant, who doubtless wondered
what whiff of excitement had stirred this remote
corner of New York state that morning; but
gleaned little from his cool, self-contained questioner.
Indeed, Power raised only one more point&mdash;could he
be driven to Racket for the late train?&mdash;and was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
assured that there would be no difficulty in that
respect.</p>

<p>Then Peter received his orders.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pack Mrs. Power&rsquo;s baggage and mine, and bring
everything here,&rdquo; said Power. &ldquo;I want you to remain
in the cabin till you hear from me; but come
to the hotel every day for a letter or telegram.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Granite nodded, and paddled off silently and swiftly.
He understood, not all, but some part, of Power&rsquo;s mood.
There were ordeals from which any man would flinch,
and high among these for the bereaved husband (as
the guide deemed him) would rank the heartbreaking
task of sorting out and folding Nancy&rsquo;s clothes, and
replacing her toilet requisites in a dressing-case. Each
garment would speak of her with a hundred mouths,
each tiny silver article and cut-glass bottle would recall
the grace of her gestures when she was brushing
her luxuriant hair or shrugging her slim shoulders
in laughing protest against Derry&rsquo;s clumsiness as a
lady&rsquo;s-maid.</p>

<p>Before Peter returned, a luncheon-gong boomed from
the porch of the hotel, and a number of men came in
from their canoes or fishing-punts. One of a small
party noticed Power sitting on a shaded seat in the
little garden which ran down to the water&rsquo;s edge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that the man with the pretty wife who lives
in Granite&rsquo;s shack?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;He looks as though
he&rsquo;d lost a dollar and found a nickel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;P&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps he&rsquo;s lost his missis,&rdquo; laughed another.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No fear. They&rsquo;re a honeymoon couple if ever there
was one. Why, when he comes here for stores she
stands at the door of the hut the whole time he is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
absent, watching him all the way here and waving to
him all the way home again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The hotelkeeper, noting Power&rsquo;s absence from the
dining-room, sent a maid to remind him that the meal
was being served.</p>

<p>Power started violently when the girl&rsquo;s soft-spoken
words broke in on his reverie. For an instant he
dreamed that Nancy had come, that he would feel her
fingers clasped over his eyes, hear her voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is so hot and quiet here,&rdquo; he explained, smiling
pleasantly, &ldquo;that I was nearly asleep. I don&rsquo;t need
any lunch, thank you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yet never had man seemed more wakeful. The girl
thought that surely he must be ill, and in pain, and she
wondered why his wife had left him; for Nancy&rsquo;s departure
was already known to the hotel servants, since
nothing could happen in that secluded nook without
their cognizance, and Willard&rsquo;s corner in horse-flesh
that morning had been much discussed in the
kitchen.</p>

<p>Granite, however, put in an appearance soon, and
insisted that Power should eat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be headin&rsquo; for N&rsquo; York, I reckon,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;an&rsquo; there ain&rsquo;t no sort o&rsquo; sense in makin&rsquo; that long
trip on an empty stummick. You jest take my say-so,
Mr. Power, an&rsquo; eat yer meals reg&rsquo;lar, an&rsquo; you&rsquo;ll size
up things altogether different when you set down to
yer breakfast tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His well-meant advice caused a thrill of agony.
Breakfast without Nancy! The dawn of the first day
when she was not by his side! The mind often works
in grooves, and Power&rsquo;s thoughts flew back to that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
other day when he lay crushed on the ledge. As he
walked to the hotel with the guide, his leg seemed to
be almost broken again, and he moved with difficulty.</p>

<p>Afterward, he spoke and acted in a curiously mechanical
way. He was aware that he gave Granite
detailed instructions, and paid him far more than the
friendly disposed fellow was inclined to accept, and
stowed himself and various portmanteaus in the buggy
when the hotel proprietor warned him it was time he
should set out. He remembered, too, being told that
a young lady and an elderly man had taken tickets
for New York by the midday train from Racket; but
the journey thenceforth was a meaningless blank. He
gave no heed to the passing of the hours. He did not
even know when the train reached the Grand Central
Station. Before he realized that he must bestir himself,
one of the attendants had to ask him sarcastically
where he wanted to go, as the engineer thought
he wouldn&rsquo;t butt into Park Avenue that morning.</p>

<p>Still behaving like one in a dream, he wandered out
of the station into 42d Street, drifted down Fifth Avenue,
and entered the Waldorf Hotel. Here, luckily,
he was recognized by a clerk&mdash;an expert who never
forgot a patron&rsquo;s name or face&mdash;and was allotted
rooms. Otherwise, he would certainly have been
turned away politely; for his unkempt appearance and
half-demented air offered the poorest of recommendations
to one of New York&rsquo;s palatial hotels.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What about your baggage, Mr. Power?&rdquo; inquired
the clerk, whose private opinion favored the view that
this erstwhile spick-and-span client had been &ldquo;hitting
it up some.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Baggage? Let me think? I have some recollection&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Power searched in his pockets, and found a number
of brass checks. He really had not the slightest
notion as to when and where that detail was attended
to, but habit had evidently proved stronger than emotion,
and some sense of gratitude stirred in him that
he had not mislaid his own few belongings&mdash;and
Nancy&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>Then, worn out physically and mentally, he threw
himself on a bed and slept. He awoke after three hours,
and some of the cloud had lifted off his brain. He
felt able to think clearly, and plan a course of action,
and that in itself was a blessing. He saw now that,
if Nancy were actually humoring a homicidal maniac,
she would lead her father straight to Newport, knowing
full well that he, Derry, would come there without
fail. True, there were sentences in that terrible
letter which hardly bore out this argument; but, then,
it was probably written under Willard&rsquo;s watching eyes,
and that last heartrending farewell might have been
the only formula she could devise for a final leave-taking
compelled by a loaded revolver.</p>

<p>At any rate, he would telegraph to Dacre, in whose
discretion he trusted implicitly; so, not without a
strenuous effort needed to collect his wits, he drafted
an ambiguously worded telegram.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;My friend&rsquo;s father came to the Adirondacks yesterday,
and effected departure forcibly during my absence. Will
you make guarded inquiries? Wire me Waldorf Hotel on
receipt of this message, and later.&rdquo;</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span></p>

<p>It was a relief to think that he had taken one decisive
step. During the two hours of inaction before
a reply could come to hand, he bathed, changed his
clothes, and ate some food, for which he was ravenous,
having refused to dine on the train.</p>

<p>Bethinking himself, too, that Nancy might have
found some means of telegraphing on her own account,
he inquired, first at the hotel bureau, but without result,
since any communications received there would
have been sent to his room, and secondly at his bank.
Yes, here were letters and telegrams galore, some readdressed
from Newport, and others sent direct. He
tore open the telegrams feverishly.</p>

<p>But what was this?</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;Your mother asking for you every hour. Why don&rsquo;t
you wire?</p>

<p class="ralign">
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">MacGonigal.</span>&rdquo;<br />
</p></div>

<p>And another:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;For Heaven&rsquo;s sake, wire if this reaches you, and start
west by next train.</p>

<p class="ralign">
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">MacGonigal.</span>&rdquo;<br />
</p></div>

<p>The messages latest in arriving were naturally on
top of the bundle, and his trembling fingers were tearing
at another envelop when someone touched him on
the shoulder. It was an official of the bank, who had
spoken to him twice in vain across the counter, and
was now standing at his side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you have bad news from Bison, Mr.
Power,&rdquo; he said gently. &ldquo;Your manager&mdash;or part<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>ner,
is it?&mdash;Mr. MacGonigal, has been telegraphing us
repeatedly during the past five days; but unfortunately
we did not know where to find you. Your mother is
ill, very ill.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is she dead?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Power could only whisper the words, and the other
noted in voice and manner what he construed as a son&rsquo;s
natural agitation at such a moment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but she is undoubtedly in danger.
It seems to me, from what MacGonigal says, that a
telegram from you telling her you are on board a west-bound
train will be more effective than any doctor&rsquo;s
treatment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Power was shaking as though from ague. He alone
knew the frightful alternative that faced him now. If
he went to Newport, he would be deserting his mother,
who was perhaps dying. If he went to Bison, he was
deserting Nancy in the hour of her utmost need. At
that instant he dared not, he could not, decide, and
the knowledge that he even hesitated was like the thrust
of a sword through his heart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he began, and his tongue seemed to refuse
its office.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I quite understand, Mr. Power,&rdquo; said the official,
an assistant manager, as it happened, and a shrewd
and kindly man. &ldquo;It is useless to think of leaving
New York before tonight. Come to my desk. I&rsquo;ll
write a telegram for you which will straighten things
out. Will you travel by the Pennsylvania and Rock
Island Route? I thought so. The train starts at
seven o&rsquo;clock; so you have plenty of time to receive
an answer from Bison. Now, how will this do?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>And he wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;Your telegrams only just opened. Coming by tonight&rsquo;s
train by Pennsylvania road. Wire me care of station agent,
Pittsburgh, Fort Wayne, Chicago, and Omaha. Message
today before six will reach me at Waldorf Hotel. Give
my love to mother and bid her cheer up.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>Power muttered what he conceived to be words of
thanks. Then, rushing to his rooms in the hotel like
a hunted animal seeking sanctuary, he read MacGonigal&rsquo;s
earlier telegrams. There were letters, too, no less
than three from his mother, who seemed perplexed and
uneasy because of the varying postmarks on his correspondence,
but made no mention of her illness.</p>

<p>Indeed, the last letter, dated only a week earlier,
spoke of a shopping expedition to Denver she and Mrs.
Moore and the two girls had taken the previous day.
MacGonigal, too, was not explicit. &ldquo;Mrs. Power very
ill and desperately anxious to see you,&rdquo; ran one telegram.
Another told of Dr. Stearn being summoned,
and remaining in constant attendance; but the burden
of each and every message was that he, Power, must
come home.</p>

<p>It was not surprising that the unhappy son should
see in his mother&rsquo;s sudden collapse the hand of the
Almighty. Deep in the heart of every man and woman
is planted the conviction that an unseen and awful
deity deals out retribution as well as justice to erring
humanity. Power was under no delusion as to his
personal responsibility for his actions. He had done
wrong, and now he was being punished. &ldquo;A man&rsquo;s
heart deviseth the way, but the Lord directeth his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
steps.&rdquo; Sternly and terribly had his feet been turned
to the new path; but if he flung himself on his knees
and prayed now, it was not for forgiveness of his
own sin, but in frenzied petition that it should not be
visited on his mother and Nancy. Even in this new
delirium of suffering he did not forget the woman
he loved. Though his torment was as the torment of
a scorpion, he asked that Nancy, too, might be spared.
On his head be the punishment; but let the Divine Ruler
of the world have pity on her youth, and find innocence
in her, for she had been hardly dealt by!</p>

<p>He was still kneeling in anguish of spirit when an
awe-stricken page entered the room with a telegram.
If aught were needed to crush him into the dust, it
was forthcoming in Dacre&rsquo;s guarded words:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;Have accidentally secured brief talk on telephone with
friend indicated, who arrived this morning Fall River
steamer. No secret made of intentions, which I am bidden
to warn you are final. Going with father to Europe
at once; but would not discuss reasons, for which, obviously,
I could not press. I am puzzled and shocked. Command
me in any way. Have you received urgent summons
to Bison? Your mother is ill.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>Then, and not until then, did some Heaven-sent clarity
of vision reveal to Power that Nancy had not been
acting a part when she wrote the letter he found in the
hut. It was only too true that, as he told Peter Granite
in the first mad words which burst from his lips,
she had left him forever. He did not pretend to understand
her motives&mdash;he was sure he never would
understand them&mdash;but her action, at least, was finite.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
He knew now she was gone beyond recall. By some
malign trick of fate she was probably stating her unalterable
resolve over the telephone to his friend at
the very moment he was reeling under the shock of
MacGonigal&rsquo;s frantic messages with reference to his
mother.</p>

<p>Well, be it so! His dream of a life&rsquo;s happiness had
been shattered by a thunderbolt from a summer sky,
and, crowning misery, here was his mother at death&rsquo;s
door, in a state of mind surely aggravated by distress
because of uncertainty as to his whereabouts! Sheer
despair was again calming if benumbing him when, by
ill-chance, his haggard eyes dwelt on Nancy&rsquo;s letter.
The concluding words seemed to grip him by the
throat:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can write no more. My poor heart is breaking.&rdquo;</p>

<p>God of mercy, what did it all mean? He gave way
utterly. A strong man weeping is a pitiable sight,
and Nancy&rsquo;s high resolve might have weakened had she
seen him in that bitter hour.</p>

<p>Perhaps she knew. She must have known. Her forlorn
soul must have gaged his distress by the measure
of her own sorrowful longing. But she had deceived
Power so thoroughly that not for many a year did he
even guess that her flight was undertaken solely on his
account. And it was better so; for the story of their
love might have been stained by a sordid tragedy, and
Power, instead of going West that night, would have
taken a special train to Newport with fixed intent to
choke Willard&rsquo;s wretched life out of him. As it was,
he crossed two-thirds of the great land which had
given him vast wealth, and much tribulation, and little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
joy. At New York, and elsewhere en route, he received
telegrams from his trusty friend at Bison. They
were not reassuring; but they did, at least, contain one
grain of comfort in the tidings that his mother still
lived.</p>

<p>But therein MacGonigal allowed his heart to control
his pen; for Mrs. Power breathed her last before
her son had quitted New York, and it was to a town
in mourning that Power returned. His mother had
endeared herself to every soul in the place. The people
looked on her as their guardian angel. They almost
scowled on John Darien Power when the flying
feet of his horse clattered along the main street in
his haste to soothe the fretfulness of a woman who
was already three days dead. Why did he leave her?
they asked. Where had he hidden that the country
should be scoured for him during the last week, and
none could find him? He used to be a decent, outspoken
sort of fellow, Derry Power; but wealth had
spoiled him, as it seemed to spoil every man who secured
it. Queer thing! Deponent thought that he,
or she, would risk the experiment at the price.</p>

<p>Thus, light-hearted gossip, which talks in headlines,
and recks little of the subtler issues of life.</p>

<h2><small>CHAPTER XII</small><br />

AFTER DARKNESS, LIGHT</h2>


<p>Death brings peace. Having accomplished its
dread mission, it atones to the body from which the
soul is snatched by smoothing away the lines of agony
from the face; it seems even to relent for awhile, and
restore to worn and aged features the semblance of
long-vanished youth.</p>

<p>When Power looked at his dead mother, he saw her
as she might have looked in placid sleep when he was
a boy in San Francisco. But a discovery that is often
soothing to those who are bereft of their nearest and
dearest brought him no consolation. His stupor of
grief and misery was denied the relief of tears. Rather
did his brooding thought run to the other extreme. The
mother he loved was at rest&mdash;why should he not join
her? He believed, like many another man who has
passed through the furnace of a soul-destroying passion,
that he had drunk the flame-wreathed cup of life
to the dregs. The fiery potion had swept through his
veins and reduced him to ashes. He was no longer
even the recluse of the Dolores Ranch, finding in books
solace for a lost love, but the burnt-out husk of his
former self. What was there left, that he should wish
to live? Why should he not end it all, and seek the
kindly oblivion of the grave?</p>

<p>Ever stronger and more insistently did this idea<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
take root in his mind, and some evil monitor seemed
to bellow it at him when he stood next day in the
cemetery, and saw the coffin lowered into the earth.
The beautiful words of the burial service give sorely
needed help to stricken hearts; but this man&rsquo;s ears were
closed to their solemn promise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am the resurrection and the life, saith the Lord:
he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall
he live.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The minister&rsquo;s voice, hitherto broken and tremulous,
for he held the dead woman in much esteem, and
her loss was grievous to him, rang out with a new
confidence when it declaimed that splendid passage; yet
Power was conscious only of a desire to cry aloud
in frenzied protest. Then that phase passed; the tumult
died down; he shrank into a lethargy which was
infinitely more dangerous than a state of wild revolt.</p>

<p>In that black mood he was watched unceasingly by
faithful friends. MacGonigal and Jake were never
far from his side. Though he did not know of, and
would have angrily resented, their quiet guardianship,
he could not have taken his own life just then, and the
time was yet far distant when he would ask himself
in wonder and thankfulness how he had escaped death
by his own hand during the first dreary hours following
his return to Bison.</p>

<p>But there were other influences at work, and one of
these made its presence felt speedily. After the funeral
he was sitting alone in the room which he had
converted into a library. His unseeing eyes were fixed
on the smiling landscape into which irrigation had converted
the once arid ranch. A troop of brood mares,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
with foals at heel, were emulating mankind by neglecting
the lush pastures at their feet and craning their
graceful necks over a palisade to nibble the thorn hedge
it protected. This double barrier shut off the lawn
and garden from the meadow lands. Here and there
the green of apple orchards, planted with artistic regard
to open vistas, was already flecked with golden
fruit. Soon the reapers would be busy on the sections
where maize and oats and wheat were ripening. The
lowing of cattle announced that milking-time was near;
for, among her other activities, Mrs. Power had established
a model dairy, and it was her gentle boast that
she had made it pay; thus bringing out in the mother
the money-coining instincts which the son had developed
so unexpectedly.</p>

<p>Such a scene might well lull the beholder to rest;
but Power was blind to its charms. He was reviewing,
in an aimless way, the associations which that very
apartment held for him. Changed though it was out
of all semblance to the poverty-stricken living-room of
the ranch, Nancy&rsquo;s spirit had never been wholly exorcised.
He pictured her slim and lissome figure as
she had stood with him at the window many an evening,
and watched the purple shadows stealing over the
hills. In that room she had married Marten. From
a bamboo stand near one of the windows she had taken
the spray of white heather which formed her wedding
bouquet. Why had she never mentioned it to him?
Or were the last five weeks nothing but some disordered
vision of the imagination, a delusion akin to
those glimpses of palm-laden oases and flashing waters
which come to thirst-maddened wanderers in deserts?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span></p>

<p>But another shadow intervened. His mother, in
turn, had loved the gorgeous sunsets of Colorado; she,
too, was wont to gaze at the far-flung panorama which
once delighted Nancy&rsquo;s eyes. And she, alas! had become
a dream which would never again wake into reality.
At that moment the relief of tears was imminent&mdash;and
tears are intolerable to a strong man. He
sprang upright in a spasm of pain, and bitter words
escaped him brokenly.</p>

<p>The movement, no less than the few disconnected sentences,
seemed to arouse Jake, who happened to be
lounging against one of the pillars of the veranda&mdash;out
of sight, perhaps, but certainly not out of hearing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Would yer keer ter hev an easy stroll around,
Mistah Power?&rdquo; he said instantly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, thanks&mdash;why are you waiting there? Do you
want to speak to me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>This questioning might bear interpretation as the
outburst of one who resented the overseer&rsquo;s presence;
but Jake was ready with the soft answer which turneth
away wrath:</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir. Not exactly, that is. I was jest waitin&rsquo;
fur Mac. He allowed he&rsquo;d be back about this time.
Gosh! Here he is, crossin&rsquo; the divide, an&rsquo; totin&rsquo; along
some tony galoot I hain&rsquo;t seen afore.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell MacGonigal, and every other person in the
place, that I am not to be disturbed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Power withdrew from the French window, and Jake
nodded to the group of horses.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re feelin&rsquo; pretty bad, I guess,&rdquo; he said to
himself. &ldquo;But thar ain&rsquo;t a gun in the outfit outside
my locked grip, an&rsquo; you cahn&rsquo;t find enough rope ter<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
hang a cat, an&rsquo; the only pisen in the ranch is on a
sideboard, an&rsquo; a skinful of that would do you good, an&rsquo;
this yer son of a gun can stand a lot o&rsquo; black looks
from you, Derry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He heard Power sink into a chair on the inner side
of the room, and sheer curiosity led him to steal along
the veranda to the porch, where MacGonigal and a
stranger were alighting from a two-wheeled buggy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Derry&rsquo;s jest tole me ter quit,&rdquo; he said in a stage
whisper, jerking his left hand, as though it still possessed
a thumb, in the direction of the library.</p>

<p>The newcomer, a tall, well-built man of middle age,
smiled involuntarily at the queer gesture. As it happened,
he had never before seen a veritable cowboy outside
the bounds of one or other of the American circus
shows which visit Europe occasionally, and Jake had
donned his costliest rig for the funeral.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shall I find Mr. Power in that room with the open
window?&rdquo; he inquired.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; said Jake.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think he will be glad to see me,&rdquo; said the unknown,
and, without further comment, he ran up the steps
and entered the veranda. The two men watched him
in silence. They saw him halt in front of the window,
and heard him say, &ldquo;Power, may I come in?&rdquo;
They heard the scraping of a chair on the parquet
floor as it was thrust aside; then the stranger
vanished.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s the dook?&rdquo; demanded Jake, vastly surprised
by the turn of events.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Friend o&rsquo; Derry&rsquo;s,&rdquo; said MacGonigal, <i>sotto voce</i>.
&ldquo;He wired me from Newport, an&rsquo; his messages struck<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
me as comin&rsquo; from a white man; so I gev&rsquo; him the fax,
an&rsquo; the nex&rsquo; thing I hear is that he&rsquo;s on the rail, but
I&rsquo;m to keep mum, as he thought it &rsquo;ud help Derry some
if he kem on him suddint. An&rsquo; here he is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>During a full minute neither man spoke. At last,
Jake, who appeared to have something on his mind,
brought it out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thar was a piece &rsquo;bout Derry and Mrs. Marten in
the <i>Rocky Mountain News</i> a week sence,&rdquo; he began.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thar was,&rdquo; agreed MacGonigal, who looked vastly
uncomfortable in a suit of heavy black cloth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not anything ter make a song of,&rdquo; went on Jake.
&ldquo;An or&rsquo;nary kind o&rsquo; yarn, &rsquo;bout a point-ter-point
steeplechase, whatever that sort o&rsquo; flam may be, an&rsquo;
Bison won, in course.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jest so,&rdquo; said the other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Guess you spotted it, too?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Guess I did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Marten&rsquo;s in Baku. Whar&rsquo;s Baku?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, but it&rsquo;s a damn long way from Newport,
anyhow, or Derry an&rsquo; Nancy wouldn&rsquo;t be cavortin&rsquo;
round together on plugs from one p&rsquo;int to any other
p&rsquo;int.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You an&rsquo; me sized up that proposition same like.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re a slick pair,&rdquo; grunted MacGonigal sarcastically.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s as may be&mdash;I&rsquo;ve heerd folk say wuss ner
that &rsquo;bout you,&rdquo; said Jake. &ldquo;But what I want ter
know is this: S&rsquo;pose some other low-down cuss gits busy,
and stirs his gray matter thinkin&rsquo; hard on things he
saw in the newspaper, what&rsquo;s ter be done?&rdquo;</p>

<p>MacGonigal brought his big red face very near<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
Jake&rsquo;s olive-skinned one. &ldquo;If he&rsquo;s on the ranch, bounce
him; if he&rsquo;s in Bison, let me know,&rdquo; he growled.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the man whose interests they were planning
to safeguard had looked up in anger when a
shadow darkened the open window; but he started to
his feet in sheer amazement when he saw Dacre and
heard his voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You?&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;How in God&rsquo;s name did <i>you</i>
get here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You were in trouble, Power, and I count it a poor
friendship that shirks a few days&rsquo; journey when a
chum is in distress.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Their hands met, and Power&rsquo;s white face showed a
wave of color. He was deeply stirred. For the moment
he was an ordinary man, and subject to ordinary
emotions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had better be outspoken,&rdquo; continued Dacre. &ldquo;I
got in touch with Mr. MacGonigal, and he informed
me of your mother&rsquo;s death; so I have hurried across
America to be with you. Being rather afraid you might
stop me en route, I requested MacGonigal not to tell
you I was coming.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I regard your action as a most kindly one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, now that I am here. For all that, old man,
you might have wired very emphatic instructions on
the point to Omaha yesterday.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear fellow, you find me in a house of mourning.
Won&rsquo;t you sit down? You must be tired. Can
I get you anything?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My bones are stiff for want of exercise&mdash;that is
all. Now, if you want to be a perfect host, have my
traps sent to my room.... Don&rsquo;t say you haven&rsquo;t a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
spare bedroom!... Good! I&rsquo;ll just open a bag, and
get some tea&mdash;of course, you can&rsquo;t possibly produce any
decent tea&mdash;and your cook will boil a kettle, and after
we have refreshed on the beverage that cheers while it
does not inebriate, you will take me for a walk around
this delightful ranch of yours. You see, I don&rsquo;t mean
to let you mope here by yourself. That is the last
thing the dear lady who has been taken from you would
wish. You will regard me as a beastly nuisance, but
that cannot be helped.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The ghost of a smile twinkled in Power&rsquo;s eyes. He
was quite alive to his friend&rsquo;s object in rattling along
in this fashion; but it was an undeniable relief that he
should be compelled to follow the lead given so cheerfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To show that you are welcome I&rsquo;ll even drink your
strong tea,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Nor am I alone here, as you
seem to imagine. There are three ladies in the house&mdash;Mrs.
Moore and her daughters, Minnie and Margaret.
Hand over your bohea to Mrs. Moore&mdash;she&rsquo;ll dispense
it properly, and appreciate it, too, I have little doubt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In such wise was the black dog care partly lifted
off Power&rsquo;s shoulders. He had yet to learn that the
human vessel cannot contain more than its due measure
of sorrow. When it is filled to the brim no additional
grief can find lodgment. Misfortune carried to
excess has made cowards brave and given fools wisdom,
and Derry Power was neither coward nor fool.</p>

<p>Mrs. Moore was naturally surprised when the visitor
was introduced; but she hailed his presence with
obvious relief. MacGonigal and Jake were invited to
join the tea-party&mdash;and, at any other time, the cow<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>boy&rsquo;s
struggles with a tiny cup and saucer of delicate
china, a microscopic teaspoon, and a roll of thin bread
and butter would have caused a good deal of merriment.
Mac, thanks to his training in the store, juggled
easily with these implements, and there was an
air almost of light-heartedness about the company before
it broke up at Power&rsquo;s suggestion that he and
Dacre might smoke while surveying some part of the
ranch.</p>

<p>Dacre showed his knowledge of human nature by
leading his friend on to talk of his mother. That way,
he was sure, lay the waters of healing. While deploring
the unhappy circumstances which attended Mrs.
Power&rsquo;s death, which Dr. Stearn put down to failure of
the heart&rsquo;s action, he swept aside her son&rsquo;s bitter self-condemnation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Death,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is the one element in human
affairs which may not be estimated in that general
way. If your mother&rsquo;s heart was affected, she was far
more likely to die of some sudden excitement than because
of a not very poignant anxiety as to your prolonged
absence from home. I suppose, in a sense, she
knew where you were?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. I&mdash;I deceived her with sufficient skill,&rdquo; came
the morbid retort.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you must school yourself to dwell on those
long years of pleasant companionship in the past
rather than this final parting, which you attribute to
a cause that exists only in your imagination. I think
Tennyson&rsquo;s philosophy is at fault in the line:</p>

<p class="poem">
&lsquo;Sorrow&rsquo;s crown of sorrow is remembering happier things.&rsquo;<br />
</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span></p>

<p>I hold that Cowper peered more closely into the fiber
and essence of humanity when he wrote:</p>

<p class="poem">
&lsquo;The path of sorrow, and that path alone,<br />
Leads to the land where sorrow is unknown;<br />
No traveler ever reached that blest abode<br />
Who found not thorns and briars in his road.&rsquo;<br />
</p>

<p class="noidt">You were utterly unnerved and wretched when the news
of your mother&rsquo;s illness reached you. You magnified
your personal responsibility out of all reasonable proportion.
I can see no proof of other influence than
the fixed course and final outcome of a disease difficult
to detect and incapable of cure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They were nearing the Gulch, Power having chosen
that direction because of the uninterrupted view of
the surrounding country they would secure from the
top of the rising ground.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish I might accept your comforting theory,&rdquo; he
said, more composedly. &ldquo;Somehow, I feel that I am
to blame, or, if that is a crude expression, that I was
made the instrument of some devilish act of retribution.
However, I do not profess myself able to regard such
a problem in a critical light today. You won&rsquo;t think
me heartless if I inquire into the conditions which led
up to the telegram you sent me in New York? I was
too dazed that morning to understand clearly what
had happened. Did you actually speak to Nancy herself
over the telephone?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you really feeling up to the strain of hearing
what took place?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Power stopped suddenly, caught his friend&rsquo;s arm,
and pointed to a small wooden structure erected
in a singular position on the western side of the
canyon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have not forgotten the story I told you that
last night in Newport?&rdquo; he cried.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. I remember every word of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, that little shack up there stands on the ledge
where I rediscovered the lode after being nearly crushed
to death. I crawled to within a few yards of this very
spot; so resolved was I that no one should rob me of
the price I was paid for Nancy. I am the same man
now that I was then, Dacre&mdash;and in a very similar
mood. Strain! I have been strained to the limit. I
have thought of taking my own life; not from lack
of capacity to endure further ills, but from sheer disgust
at the crassness of things. At least, then, let me
inquire into their meaning. What did she say to you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Despite his unwillingness to add to the heavy load
Power had to bear, Dacre was not altogether sorry
to get an unpleasing task over and done with. But he
felt his way carefully; since he, too, was groping in
the dark to a certain extent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your telegram did not take me wholly by surprise,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;I knew that Nancy&mdash;you don&rsquo;t mind
if I use her name in that way, do you? Well, then, I
had heard of her return. Mrs. Van Ralten rang me up
to say that Mr. Willard and his daughter had arrived
by the steamer in the early morning. I think
I took such astounding news calmly enough; but I have
a suspicion that the good lady herself was a trifle
worried, and was only too glad to have the chance of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
announcing the fact of her friend&rsquo;s reappearance. She
added that Nancy was ill, having been overcome by
the terrific heat in New York, and I chimed in with
the proper sentiments; though I have seldom been more
bewildered than at that moment. Soon afterward your
message came, and I began dimly to grasp the position.
I seized the pretext of Mrs. Van Ralten&rsquo;s statement
to call up Nancy&rsquo;s residence, and, by some sort
of fortune, whether good or bad I can&rsquo;t determine, she
herself answered. I concocted a suitable excuse; but
she solved the difficulty at once by saying that, as your
friend, I ought to know the facts. She had resolved
to leave you, &lsquo;to put an end to a mad dream&rsquo; was a
phrase she used, and asked me to tell you that she
adhered resolutely to the decision she had announced in
a letter the previous day. She added that she was sailing
in a steamer from Boston with her father that
night, and hoped I would spread the impression that
she had been ill, and needed a sea voyage. I can assure
you, old chap, I was completely flabbergasted.
Admiring her as I do, I would never have believed that
she would act in that extraordinary manner had I not
received the story from her own lips, if one may so
describe a conversation by telephone. I was so horribly
afraid lest some outsider in the hotel might overhear
me that I dared not question her. The talk was
studiously formal on her part, and I was so thoroughly
cut up that I could not attempt to convey my impressions
in your telegram. Moreover, as a diligent
student of Shakespeare, was I not warned that</p>

<p class="poem">
&lsquo;Though it be honest, it is never good<br />
To bring bad news.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>&rsquo;<br />
</p>

<p class="noidt">Certainly, I was not quite in the position of Cleopatra&rsquo;s
messenger, since I could only confirm a disaster
already known to you; but I literally shrank from the
obvious inferences. Then came MacGonigal&rsquo;s revelation
of events here. I simply couldn&rsquo;t rest. After a
miserable twenty-four hours of vacillation, I started
for New York, calling at your hotel to make sure
you had gone west. One thing more. A Chicago newspaper
gave a list of passengers sailing from Boston in
a Red Star liner. In it were the names of Nancy and
her father.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For an appreciable time after Dacre had concluded
neither man spoke. Then Power said quietly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thus endeth the second lesson.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His companion was not one who indulged in platitudes.
Some men, kind-hearted and pitying, would
have reminded him that he was still young, that life
was rich in promise, that time would heal, or, at any
rate, sear, the ugliest wounds. But Dacre said none
of these things. He merely asked if Power meant to
tell him what really happened in the Adirondacks. A
good talker, he was also a good listener. Power would
recover, he was convinced. He was not the first man,
nor would he be the last, to clasp a phantom and find
it air. Meanwhile, outspoken confidence should provide
an efficient safety-valve for emotions contained
at too high a pressure.</p>

<p>Power yielded to this friendly urging, but not instantly.
Indeed, he astonished the Englishman by his
next utterance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nearly four years ago,&rdquo; he said, looking back at
the ranch &ldquo;in that room where you found me today,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
I was reading &lsquo;The Autocrat&rsquo; to Nancy one night, and
a certain passage caught our attention. It ran somewhat
like this: &lsquo;I would have a woman as true as
death. At the first lie which works from the heart
outward, she should be tenderly chloroformed into a
better world.&rsquo; Both of us laughed then, and now I
know why we laughed. We were ignorant. Holmes,
genial cynic that he was, understood women; he wrote
a vital thing when he described the sort of lie that
comes from the heart. I put trust in two women, and
one of them has betrayed it. If I live another fifty
years, I shall never understand why Nancy left me&mdash;never,
never! I would as soon have thought of suspecting
an angel from heaven of disloyalty as
Nancy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Has she proved disloyal?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What else? I tried to find comfort in the belief
that her father compelled her to accompany him by
threatening to kill her if she refused. But, in these
days, that sort of melodrama does not endure beyond
its hour. She could have escaped him fifty times during
the last six days. She could have appealed to
you for help. Mary Van Ralten would at least have
shielded her from murder. Yet, what are the facts?
In a letter to me she pleaded duty as an excuse. She
must have had some similar plea in her mind when
she spoke to you. And she has gone to Europe&mdash;to
rejoin Marten!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He broke off with a gesture of disdain. He was in
revolt. The statue which had glowed into life under
the breath of his love was hardening into polished ivory
again.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;May I see that letter?&rdquo; said Dacre.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. Here it is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The older man read and reread Nancy&rsquo;s sorrow-laden
words.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She tells you her poor heart is breaking&mdash;I believe
her&mdash;in every syllable,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Believe her&mdash;when she prates of duty&mdash;to Marten?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t profess to understand, yet I believe. I
do, on my soul!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Power&rsquo;s face grew dark with a grim humor that was
more tragic than misery. &ldquo;Am I to follow&mdash;by the
next steamer?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. She will come back&mdash;send for you. The present
deadlock cannot last.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Again Power showed his disbelief by a scornful
grimace. &ldquo;I am so deeply beholden to your friendship
that I claim the privilege of saying that you are talking
nonsense,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;She vowed the fidelity to me
which I gave unreservedly to her; but what sort of
inconstant ideal inspired her faith, that it should be
shattered to atoms by the first real test? Could I
ever trust her again? If it were possible, which it is
not, that some new whim drove her back to America,
am I a toy dog to be whistled to heel as soon as her
woman&rsquo;s caprice dictates? To please her father, she
married Marten; to placate her father, she has gone
back to Marten; to gratify some feminine impulse, she
flung herself in my arms; when impulse, or duty as she
calls it, again overcomes reason, she may summon her
obedient slave once more. Would I run to her call?
I don&rsquo;t know. My God! I don&rsquo;t know.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; was the quiet response; &ldquo;nor
do you know how unjust you are being to her, leaving
me out of the question altogether. You are like a dismasted
ship in a storm, driven this way and that by
every cross sea, yet drifting hopelessly nearer a rock-bound
coast. Yet men have saved their lives even in
such desperate conditions. At the worst, short of
death, they have scrambled ashore, bruised and maimed,
but living. Now, I ask you to suspend judgment for
a few days, or weeks. Enlightenment may come&mdash;it
<i>must</i> come&mdash;perhaps from a source you little dream
of now. Suppose I practise what I preach, and talk
of something else. I think I have whipped you out of
a lethargy that was harmful, and, in so far, have done
you good. But I&rsquo;m not here to discuss problems of
psychology which are insoluble&mdash;for the present, at
any rate. Tell me something of your property, of the
mine, of Bison. What delightful character-types you
picked up in MacGonigal and that picturesque-looking
cowboy. And how did the latter gentleman lose
the thumb off his left hand? Was it a mere accident?
I hope not. I rather expect to hear a page
out of the real history of the wild and woolly
West.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Power was slightly ashamed of his outburst already.
&ldquo;You make me feel myself a blatant misanthropist,&rdquo;
he said contritely. &ldquo;I had no right to blaze out at
you in that way. But, now you are here, you shall
not escape so easily. Again, and most heartily, I thank
you for coming. I realize now that what I wanted
more than anything else in the world was some sympathetic
ear into which to pour my griefs. Ordinarily,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
I am not that sort of man. I prefer to endure the
minor ills of life in silence. But I have been slammed
so hard this time that self-control became a torture.
I think I reached the full extent of my resources when
I stood by my mother&rsquo;s open grave today, and saw
her name on the coffin. I wanted to tear my heart out
with my own hands. For a few seconds I was actually
insane.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;MacGonigal told me how terribly shaken you were.
He said you would have fallen if he had not held
you up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, was that it? I suppose I nearly fainted.
Some nerve in my brain seemed to snap. Perhaps that
is why I am talking at random now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Not all Dacre&rsquo;s tact could stop the imminent recital
of events since their last meeting. Yet, curiously
enough, Power seemed to grow calmer, more even-minded,
as he told of his idyl and its dramatic close.
By the time they had reached the house again he had
recast his views as to Nancy&rsquo;s desertion of him. During
some few days thereafter Fate ceased her outrageous
attacks, and he was vouchsafed a measure of
peace.</p>

<p>The next blow came from an unexpected hand. Mrs.
Moore and her daughters were about to leave Bison
for their home in San Francisco. All preparations
were made, and their baggage was piled on the veranda
ready for transport to the station, when the good lady
who had proved such a stanch friend in an emergency
called Power into the library. He noticed that she
was carrying a small package, wrapped in a piece of
linen, and tied with white ribbon.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Derry,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I have one sad duty to perform
before I go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He winced slightly. He was beginning to hate that
word &ldquo;duty.&rdquo; The very sound of it was ominous, full
of foreboding.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is nothing to cause you any real sorrow,&rdquo; she
went on, thinking he had misinterpreted her words.
&ldquo;Just before your dear mother&rsquo;s death she gave me to
understand that I was to take charge of a bundle of
letters which she kept under her pillow. They were
meant for you, I suppose; but unfortunately I could
not make out her wishes. Anyhow, here they are. You
are the one person in the world who can decide whether
or not they should be destroyed. I put them in a
locked box, and would have given them to you sooner,
but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; She hesitated, seemingly at a loss for a
word.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I was acting like a lunatic, and you were
afraid of the consequences,&rdquo; he said, with a pleasant
smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I have never seen any man so hard hit,&rdquo; she
admitted. &ldquo;Mr. Dacre&rsquo;s arrival was a perfect Godsend,
for you and all of us; so I thought it best to
keep these letters longer than I had planned at first,
though I am sure there is nothing in them to cause
you any distress. Indeed, I have an idea that they
are mostly your own correspondence, sent from New
York and elsewhere, because I saw your handwriting
on an envelop, and a postmark. You are not vexed
with me for retaining them until today?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Power reassured her on that point. He placed the
packet, just as it was, in a drawer of a writing-desk,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
and did not open it until he had returned from
the station after escorting the women to their
train.</p>

<p>Dacre had strolled to the outbuildings to inspect
a reaping-machine of new design which had been procured
for harvesting work; so the room was otherwise
untenanted when the son began to examine his
mother&rsquo;s last bequest. At first it seemed as if Mrs.
Moore&rsquo;s surmise was correct. The first few letters he
glanced at were those he had despatched from New
York and Newport. Then he came upon others posted
at Racket, and a twinge of remorse shook him when
he recalled the subterfuges and evasions they contained.
Still it had been impossible to set forth the truth, and
there was a crumb of comfort in the fact that he had
written nothing untrue.</p>

<p>He was so disturbed by the painful memories evoked
by each date that he was on the verge of tying the bundle
together again when his eye was caught by one
letter in a strange handwriting. The postmark showed
that it hailed from New York, and the date was a
curious one, being exactly six days after he and Nancy
went from Newport.</p>

<p>Instantly he was aware of a strong impulse to burn
that particular letter forthwith. Perhaps some psychic
influence made itself felt in that instant. Perhaps a
gentle and loving spirit reached from beyond the veil,
and made one last effort to secure the fulfilment of a
desire balked by the cruel urgency of death. But the
forces of evil prevailed, and Power withdrew the written
sheet from its covering.</p>

<p>And this is what he read:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;Madam.&mdash;Your son, John Darien Power, has probably
represented to you that he is detained in the East
by certain horse-dealing transactions. That is a lie. He
has gone off with another man&rsquo;s wife. But his punishment
will be swift and sure. He cannot escape it. Its nature
will depend on the decision arrived at by the woman he
has wronged. I am telling you the facts so that you may
be in a position to form a just judgment, whether or not
you ever see him again. Keep this letter; although it is
unsigned. If circumstances require its production, the
writer will not shirk responsibility for either its statements
or its threats.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>Dacre came in nearly an hour later. After witnessing
an exhibition of the new reaper, he had gone with
Jake to admire some of Power&rsquo;s recent purchases in
horse-flesh, and the time passed rapidly. When he
entered the room, he found his friend sitting in the
shadows.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know you had returned.
I&rsquo;ve been vetting those black Russians you
bought at Newport. What a pair for a tandem!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did Dr. Stearn ever tell you the exact cause of my
mother&rsquo;s death?&rdquo; was the curiously inappropriate reply,
uttered in a low tone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Y-yes; acute ulcerative endocarditis was the actual
cause. But why in the world do you ask such a
question now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because our worthy doctor was mistaken. I alone
know why she died. I killed her. You recollect I
said as much to you the day you arrived.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish to goodness you would cease talking, or even
thinking, such arrant rubbish!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing could be so certain. Willard wrote and
told her I had taken Nancy away from Marten. Willard
struck the blow; but I forged the weapon. My
mother lay dying while I was philandering with another
man&rsquo;s wife. Poor soul! She tried to have the
letter destroyed&mdash;to spare me, no doubt&mdash;but the dagger
I placed in Willard&rsquo;s hand had pierced so deep that
she died with the words of forgiveness on her lips.
No, you need not worry unduly, Dacre; though I have
no right to harrow your feelings in this way. I shall
not anticipate the decree of Providence by self-murder.
My worst chastisement now is to live, knowing that I
killed my mother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What damned rot!&rdquo; broke out Dacre furiously.</p>

<p>Power rose, went to his friend, and put a hand on
his shoulder. He smiled, with an odd semblance of
content.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a good chap,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but a poor actor.
You know I am right. You wouldn&rsquo;t stand in my
shoes for all the gold in the Indies; &lsquo;for what doth it
profit a man if he gain the whole world and lose his
own soul?&rsquo; I&rsquo;ve lost mine. I must try and find it again.
Don&rsquo;t you see? That is my only chance. Good God!
If there is another and a better life hereafter, I cannot
meet my mother and tell her that I valued my wretched
husk of a body so greatly that I made no search for
the soul I flung away. I&rsquo;ve thought it all out. The
road is open and marked with signposts. A man
without a soul can surely afford to risk his body.
Come! It is growing dark, and this room will soon
be peopled with ghosts. Let&rsquo;s walk in the fresh, cool
air, and I&rsquo;ll explain myself clearly.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><small>CHAPTER XIII</small><br />

THE BEGINNING OF THE
PILGRIMAGE</h2>


<p>At first none save Dacre knew what was going on.
To MacGonigal and Jake it seemed that Power was
merely seeking distraction by putting his affairs in
order, and they regarded such healing activity with
joy. People in Bison, too, were delighted by the change
in his habits. The man who used to leave to his mother
everything connected with the social well-being of the
town now gave these matters his close interest, and
inquired thoroughly into the philanthropic schemes to
which she had devoted so much time and almost unstinted
means; incidentally, he contrived to puzzle Dr.
Stearn.</p>

<p>One day, when in Denver on business, he called at
the doctor&rsquo;s house.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want you to clear up a point that is bothering
me,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Suppose nothing unusual had occurred
to hasten my mother&rsquo;s death, how long would she have
lived?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing unusual did occur,&rdquo; insisted Stearn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! I have expressed myself awkwardly. How
long, then, under the most favorable conditions, could
she have lived?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Three or four years.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Five?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is possible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Six?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should doubt it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Seven?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are marching too rapidly. If Mrs. Power
lived seven years with inflamed aortic valves, I should
regard the fact as something akin to a miracle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But miracles do happen, even in science?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Um&mdash;yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Doctor. That is all I wish to know.
Anything you want for your poorer patients?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Stearn laughed. &ldquo;Great Scott!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;you
ought to come with me on a round of visits. It would
be an eye-opener for a wealthy young sprig like you.
Why, if I had ten dollars a day to spend on special
diet, stimulants, and the like, I could get through every
cent of the money.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sorry I haven&rsquo;t time today for slumming. Goodby.
I may not see you again for quite awhile.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Going abroad?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; but my plans are indefinite.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, young man, when you come back to Colorado,
bring a wife, or, better still, look around for one
before you go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll think it over. But I must be off. I&rsquo;m due at
my lawyer&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Those fellows who rake in gold by the bushel
are all alike,&rdquo; grumbled Stearn, when the door had
closed on his visitor. &ldquo;I did imagine, after what he
had said, that he would skin a fifty off his wad for the
benefit of the poor bedridden devils on my list. Ah,
well! They&rsquo;ll miss his mother at Bison. And what<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
did he mean by his questions? On my honor, he struck
me as slightly cracked.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A fortnight later, when Power was far beyond the
reach of thanks, the cashier of Smith &amp; Moffat&rsquo;s bank
sent a formal little note, stating that he was instructed
by Mr. John Darien Power to hand him (Dr. Stearn)
one hundred dollars on the first of every month during
the next seven years, &ldquo;for the benefit of the sick poor
in your district, and in memory of Mary Elizabeth
Power.&rdquo; If the doctor would kindly call, etc.</p>

<p>Stearn rubbed his chin thoughtfully. &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said he,
to himself, &ldquo;is <i>that</i> what he was after? Well, it&rsquo;s a
lesson, even to a grayhead like me. I misjudged him
shockingly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That same period of seven years proved a stumbling-block
to others beside the gruff but kind-hearted medico.
Peter MacGonigal, for one, was &ldquo;dog-goned etarnally&rdquo;
when he heard of it. A lawyer and two bankers, one
from Denver and another from New York, were appointed
trustees of Power&rsquo;s estate, real and personal,
and the arrangement was partly explained to Mac
and Jake, so that they might understand how their
interests would be safeguarded. On that historic occasion
Jake&rsquo;s real name was disclosed. Hitherto, no one
in Bison believed that he possessed a surname; but,
under pressure, he &ldquo;allowed&rdquo; he was &ldquo;riz&rdquo; in Texas,
and his father&rsquo;s name was James Cutler.</p>

<p>The arrangement was that MacGonigal should control
the mine and Jake the ranch for seven years. If
Power did not return about the end of that time, and
both men were living, a further six months should
be allowed to pass, and then each would become the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
owner of the respective properties under highly favorable
terms.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I may as well say that I shall come back right
enough,&rdquo; said Power, smiling at their bewilderment.
&ldquo;I am only settling matters now to please my lawyer,
who wants to avoid a suit for intestacy, or a long
argument to presume my death in case I am not heard
of again. That is all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it?&rdquo; gasped MacGonigal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. In any event, neither of you will be a
loser.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But whar in hell air you goin&rsquo;, Derry?&rdquo;</p>

<p>This, from the man who never swore, was electrical.
Jake said afterward that he felt his hair &ldquo;stannin&rsquo;
right up on end.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am undertaking a quest,&rdquo; said Power seriously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; what the&mdash;Gosh! I&rsquo;ll bust! What&rsquo;s a
&lsquo;quest,&rsquo; anyhow?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In this instance, it implies a pilgrimage in far
lands. Don&rsquo;t ask me anything else, Mac, because I
shall not answer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be needin&rsquo; a plug or two, maybe?&rdquo; put in
Jake anxiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I do, I&rsquo;ll send word.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They could extract no further information. Certain
documents were signed with due solemnity, and
the conclave broke up. The three trustees took the
opportunity offered by Power&rsquo;s departure for the town
to sound Dacre, who was present, as to their client&rsquo;s
intentions. But he, as a loyal friend, though greatly
in Power&rsquo;s confidence, could not reveal his motives;
while, as to his plans, he was free to admit, quite can<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>didly,
that he had not the slightest notion of their
nature. Thus, Bison awoke one morning to find that
its chief citizen had left the place overnight. It was
only by degrees that the inhabitants discovered how
thoroughly he had inquired into and anticipated local
needs. Means were forthcoming for every judicious social
enterprise. The man had gone; but his money
remained.</p>

<p>Dacre accompanied him to Denver. They separated
on a platform of the station at the foot of 17th Street,
and, at the twelfth hour, the Englishman made a last
effort to dissuade his friend from embarking on what
he regarded as a fantastic adventure.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know where you are heading for, Power,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;You have not told me, and I can only suppose
you mean to be lost to the world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Something like that,&rdquo; and Power smiled frankly.
His face no longer wore the hunted, harassed aspect
of a man who finds the unhappiness of life almost unbearable.
A new look had come into his eyes. He
seemed to be gazing constantly at some far horizon not
bounded by earth and sky, a dim, sunless line beyond
which lay a mysterious land of peace, a kingdom akin
to Nirvana, the realm of extinction.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shall I not hear from you, even once a year?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is improbable,&rdquo; was the grave answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I refuse to believe that you and I are parting
now forever.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If Providence wills it, we shall meet again. I hope
so. If ever I find myself back in the crowded highway,
I shall look for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t I induce you, even now, to come with me to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
England? I&rsquo;m tired of globe-trotting. You would
find my place in Devonshire a quiet nook.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come to you sometime.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then, greatly daring, Dacre urged a plea so cruelly
direct that he had not ventured to use it before this
final moment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you reflected as to the effect of this action
of yours on Nancy when she hears of it?&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;I may run up against her. There are only ten thousand
of us, you know. She will surely ask me what has
become of you. What am I to tell her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Power had not spoken of Nancy during a month or
more, and his friend thought that a sudden thrusting
of her image before his eyes would startle him out
of the semihypnotic condition in which he appeared
to exist. But, to Dacre&rsquo;s chagrin and astonishment,
the ruse failed utterly. Power evidently found the
point thus unexpectedly raised somewhat perplexing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell her?&rdquo; he repeated, in a most matter-of-fact
tone. &ldquo;Is it necessary to tell her anything? But, of
course, you will say you saw the last of me, and a
woman hates to be ignored, even by the man she has
discarded. Tell her, then, that in India there are
Hindus of devout intent who measure two thousand
miles of a sacred river by prostrations along its banks.
These devotees have done no wrong to any human being,
and their notion of service is sublimely ridiculous.
But if, among them, was a poor wretch who had committed
an unforgivable crime, and <i>he</i> thought to expiate
it by carrying sharp flints on which to fling
himself each yard of the way, one could understand
<i>him</i>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is no message to Nancy,&rdquo; persisted Dacre.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If she pouts, and says so, remind her of my mother&rsquo;s
death.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I shall leave you in anger if you talk in that
way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, you won&rsquo;t. You&rsquo;re really more than a little
sorry for me. You think, perhaps, I am rather mad;
but, on reflection, you will be pleased at that, because
a lunatic can be contented in his folly, and I know
you wish me content. Here&rsquo;s my train. San Francisco
is a great jumping-off place. &lsquo;Last seen in
San Francisco&rsquo; is quite a common headline in the
newspapers. Goodby! I&rsquo;ll look you up in Devonshire,
never fear. Mind you are there to receive
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And he was gone. Dacre turned his face to the east.
During the long journey to Washington, where he
meant to visit some friends before crossing the Atlantic,
he thought often of Power. Speaking of him one day
to a man of some influence in the Department of State,
he inquired if there were any means of keeping track
of the wanderer without his cognizance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the official. &ldquo;We can send out a private
consular note. Have you any idea which way he
is heading?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not the faintest. From a sort of hint he let drop,
he may intend joining a Buddhist community in India
or Ceylon. At any rate, he had been reading some
book on India. But the assumption is too vague to
be of value.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll see what can be done.&rdquo;</p>

<p>By the next mail, every United States consulate in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
the world was asked to report to Washington if John
Darien Power, an American citizen, appeared within
its jurisdiction. No report ever arrived. Long before
the inquiry reached the one consul who might have
learned something of his whereabouts, Power had vanished
off the map; a phrase which, in this instance, happened
to be literally true. Thus, Dacre&rsquo;s well-meant
efforts to keep in touch with his friend were frustrated,
and, for the time, he drops out of this
history.</p>

<p>When Power arrived in San Francisco, though his
definite project as to the future involved a long disappearance
from the haunts of civilized men, he had
not decided where to pitch his tent. He had actually
thought, as Dacre surmised, of going to the inner fastnesses
of the Himalayas; but his voluntary exile
connoted something more than mere effacement&mdash;it
meant suffering, and sacrifice, and the succor of earth&rsquo;s
miserable ones&mdash;and the barrier of language shut out
the East. Again, there was little, if any, element of
danger attached to a sojourn in the hilly solitudes of
Hindustan; it even appealed to his student&rsquo;s proclivities.
So, for that reason alone, it was dismissed. Spanish
was the only foreign tongue he was thoroughly
conversant with, and his thoughts turned to Spanish-speaking
South America. He made up his mind to go
there, and search for his field.</p>

<p>San Francisco was the city of his childhood. In
happier conditions, it could hardly fail to evoke pleasant
memories. The Moores lived there, and they, aided
by a host of oldtime acquaintances, would gladly have
made him welcome; but he avoided such snares by driv<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>ing
straight to the offices of the Pacific Steamship Company,
where he ascertained that the mail steamer
<i>Panama</i> sailed for Valparaiso that day.</p>

<p>He was on board within the hour, and remained in
his cabin until the engines started. Then he went
on deck, and bade farewell to a land where he had
worked, and dreamed, and endured, during the full
years of his lost youth. Practically his last intimate
glimpse of the West, save for distant views of the California
coast, and a fleeting call at San Diego, was
obtained when the vessel passed through the Golden
Gate. Bitter-sweet recollections warred in heart and
brain as he watched the beautiful and well-loved panorama.
Every bold promontory and sequestered bay of
the miles of narrow straits were familiar to his eyes.
If there was aught of weakness in his composition, it
must have made its presence felt then; but that there
could be any turning back did not even occur to his
vague thoughts. He might be moving swiftly into
unfathomable night; his action might be deemed either
stubborn or irresponsible; he might be regarded as the
victim of deep delusion; but at least it must be said
of him that he never flinched from the barren outlook
or admitted the possibility of retreat. Hitherto love
for his mother had exercised the most lasting and salutary
influence on his life. The depth and intensity
of that love was the gage of his horror when he discovered
that he had caused her death. His emotions
were incapable of logical analysis. She was dead. His
forbidden passion for another woman had killed her.
She might have lived seven years. For seven years he
would placate her spirit &ldquo;in weariness and painfulness,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
in watchings often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings
often, in cold and nakedness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His strength was that of the mind. He was of the
order of chivalry. His renunciation would have been
well understood by a few men who lived and had their
being a thousand years ago. In the America of the
early &rsquo;90&rsquo;s, had his undertaking been known, which
it was not, nor ever has been till this writing, the heedless
majority must have wagged sapient noddles, and
cried in chorus, &ldquo;He is mad!&rdquo;</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>A discriminating purser allotted him to the captain&rsquo;s
table, and at dinner that evening he found himself
next to a Chilean merchant. This man sat on his left.
On the right was an empty chair, which adjoined the
commander&rsquo;s position at the head of the table.</p>

<p>The captain greeted him with the ready camaraderie
of the sea.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My ward has not put in an appearance,&rdquo; he said,
nodding toward the vacant place. &ldquo;She can&rsquo;t be ill
yet, anyhow; but, like most women, I suppose, she is
unpunctual.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is lack of punctuality a feminine failing?&rdquo; said
Power, seeing that he was expected to answer.</p>

<p>The sailor laughed. &ldquo;It is evident you are not a
married man, Mr. Power, or you wouldn&rsquo;t need to ask,&rdquo;
he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How true!&rdquo; piped the Chilean, in a singularly high-pitched
voice. The people at that end of the table
grinned, and the Chilean instantly won a reputation as
a humorist. Some days passed before they discovered
that he had brought off his only joke thus early in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
voyage. He possessed a fund of information about nitrate
and guano; but these topics were not popular,
so his conversational talent exhausted itself in that one
comment. On this occasion it happened to be appropriate.</p>

<p>Power, who had summed him up as a dull dog at a
glance, was surveying him with a degree of surprise
when he became aware that the missing lady had arrived.
She had slipped into her chair quietly, and was
apologizing for being late.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am usually a most methodical person,&rdquo; she said;
&ldquo;but I mislaid a key&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>She broke off, in smiling embarrassment, because of
the general laughter, and the captain had to explain
that the wretched males present had been vilifying
her sex.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There was one exception, though,&rdquo; he rattled on.
&ldquo;Our friend on your left seemed to think otherwise.
Mr. Power, let me introduce you to Miss Marguerite
Sinclair.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yielding to convention&mdash;most potent of human ties&mdash;Power
turned with a polite bow; but not even his
preoccupied mind was proof against the feeling of stupefaction
caused by his first impression of the captain&rsquo;s
&ldquo;ward.&rdquo; She certainly owned a girlish and graceful
figure, and her brown hair was glossy and abundant;
but her skin was withered, and that side of her face
which was visible bore a number of livid scars. It was
impossible to determine her age. The slim, willowy
body and really beautiful hair apparently indicated
youth; but the appalling disfigurement of the face,
which extended from the top of the cheek to the slender<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
column of her neck, simply forbade any accurate estimate.
The pity of it was that her profile was faultless,
and a little pink shell of an ear was almost fantastically
opposed to the shriveled and scar-seamed features adjoining
it. Yet, in some indescribable way, she
reminded him of Nancy, and the notion was so grotesque
and abhorrent that he shuddered.</p>

<p>Luckily, her attention was drawn for a moment by
a steward, and he had recovered his wits before she
looked at him. Then he found that her eyes were peculiarly
brilliant. He noted, with positive relief, that they
were not blue, like Nancy&rsquo;s, but brown. They had a
curiously penetrative quality, too, which seemed to dispel
the repugnant effect of the accident. He saw now
that she must have sustained some grave injury, which
marred her good looks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; she said composedly. &ldquo;Usually, I
have to fight my own battles. It will be quite a relief
to count on an ally so valiant that he draws the sword
without waiting to see the person whose cause he
espouses.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her voice was cultured and incisive. It seemed to
offer a challenge to all the world; yet it held an arresting
note of cheerful irony that betokened an equable
temperament. After the first shock of surprise, almost
of dismay, had passed, Power fancied that she carried
herself thus bravely as a protest against the brutality
of fate.</p>

<p>They spoke but little during the progress of the
meal, and he avoided looking at her. Somehow, he was
aware that she would resent such delicacy; but the alternative
of a too curious inspection was distasteful.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
Of two evils he chose the less; though the fact that any
choice was called for in the matter was embarrassing.</p>

<p>He gathered that the captain and Miss Sinclair were
old acquaintances. There were allusions to relatives
and friends. She was addressed as &ldquo;Meg.&rdquo; It was to
be inferred that her mother was dead, that she had
been attending a session of the Los Angeles University,
and that she was now on the way to rejoin her father.</p>

<p>Some man at the table spoke of the pending Presidential
campaign, and the &ldquo;sixteen to one&rdquo; currency
ratio started a lively argument. An advocate of a gold
basis snorted derisively that silver could be mined profitably
at eighteen cents an ounce.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How true!&rdquo; said the Chilean, and again he scored.</p>

<p>Power escaped to the deck. He lit a cigar, and leaned
on the starboard rail, gazing at a magnificent sunset
which glorified the infinity of waters. He wished now
he had avoided a mail steamer, with its elaborate elegancies.
Had he not acted so precipitately he could
have sought the rough hospitality of some grimy tramp,
whence woman was barred, and whose skipper would
leave him in peace.</p>

<p>Suddenly he was disturbed by Miss Sinclair, who
joined him at the rail with a quiet confidence of demeanor
that spoke volumes for her self-possession.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Though I appeared to make light of it at the moment,
I was glad to hear that you defended me,&rdquo; she
said, smiling at him with those lustrous, deep-seeing
eyes.</p>

<p>He was rendered nearly tongue-tied by confusion;
but managed to blurt out, awkwardly enough, that his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
championship had been involuntary. She laughed quite
pleasantly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does that mean that, now you have seen me, you
deem me capable of any iniquity?&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You give me credit for a faculty of divination which
I do not possess,&rdquo; he retorted, wondering if she was
really alluding to her own unsightliness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, I think I shall like you,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Most
people whom I meet for the first time try to show their
pity by being sympathetic. They simply daren&rsquo;t say,
&lsquo;Good gracious! what has happened to your poor face?&rsquo;
so they put on their best hospital-ward-visitor air, and
feel so sorry for me that I want to smack them. Now,
you admit candidly that I may be as villainous as I
look, and such honesty is a positive relief.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Even to earn your good opinion I refuse to accept
that unfair reading of my words,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then what did you mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I was talking at random.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t look that sort of person. Really, Mr.
Power, you and I will get on famously together if we
tell each other the real truth. Are we to be fellow-passengers
as far as Valparaiso?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There, you see! Those other Philistines would have
smirked and said, &lsquo;I hope so.&rsquo; I shall enjoy this trip.
Generally, a sea-voyage bores me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you much traveled, then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I live in Patagonia.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does that statement answer my question?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, yes. No one lives in Patagonia for amusement,
and some among those who are compelled to re<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>side
there get away as often as their means permit.
Patagonian boarding-houses don&rsquo;t advertise &lsquo;young and
musical society,&rsquo; I assure you. Our population is something
under one to the square mile.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My knowledge of the Patagonian is limited; but I
have always understood that he requires just about
that amount of space.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, no! Our poor giants are nearly extinct.
There is hardly a hundred of them, all told.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My! Who, or what, cleared them out?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Measles. Just imagine a Brobdingnagian measle!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you, then, a type of the present inhabitants?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. My ailment was due to being knocked insensible
during a fire.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Power reddened. &ldquo;You are an adept in twisting the
sense of the most commonplace remarks, to say the
least,&rdquo; he said, careless whether or not he annoyed her.</p>

<p>She parried this thrust with sublime unconcern: &ldquo;I
know. It&rsquo;s horrid. But I had to tell you. Now
I&rsquo;ll be good, and take myself off. You&rsquo;ll be heartily
sick of my company after five thousand miles of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Certainly Miss Marguerite Sinclair&rsquo;s unusual methods
of expressing herself struck a jarring note, and,
whether by chance or by the exercise of rare intuition,
the one note able to penetrate Power&rsquo;s armor of
indifference. Her somewhat bizarre personality was
vivid in his mind long after she had left him; but
night and the stars brought other thoughts, and
blurred the sharp lines of the vignette.</p>

<p>Next morning he breakfasted early, and alone. After
a long tramp on the upper deck, he asked a steward
where a deck-chair ordered overnight had been placed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
The man inquired his name, consulted a list, and led
him through the music-room to the port side. The
chair stood aft of the companionway, and it was irritating
to find the neighboring chair occupied by a
young and remarkably pretty woman, who seemed to
be deeply engrossed in a book.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I prefer the starboard side,&rdquo; he said sharply.
&ldquo;Bring it along, and I&rsquo;ll show you where to put it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The lady lifted her eyes to his in an amused, sidelong
glance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-morning, Mr. Power,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You are
pardoned for thinking there is a conspiracy floating
around; but there isn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Power was staggered; but he did not mean to provide
a permanent target for the shafts of Miss Marguerite
Sinclair&rsquo;s wit. At present she was treating him as
though she were &ldquo;rotting&rdquo; some small schoolboy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Leave the chair&mdash;I have changed my mind,&rdquo; he
said, and dismissed the steward with a tip. Then he
sat down, and scrutinized the girl so brazenly that her
eyes fell, and she blushed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is no help for it,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;I suppose
we ought to be able, at least, to recognize each
other when we meet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should know you again in twenty years; you are
not a two-faced person, like me,&rdquo; she retorted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is consoling to find that you can be as unfair
to yourself as you were to me last night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Would you have me twist my neck like a parrot,
and say, &lsquo;Please look on this picture, not on that,&rsquo; when
a stranger happens to be to port instead of to starboard?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do really think it would be worth while,&rdquo; he
said.</p>

<p>He saw now that she was a girl of twenty or thereabouts,
and a singularly attractive one from this new
point of view. He felt that he must atone for the curt
order to the steward; but she only laughed at the implied
compliment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The poor fellow saw us talking together, and arranged
the chairs accordingly,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m frankly
pleased, and you say you are; so that&rsquo;s all right. Let
us swap symptoms, as grand folk do in society. I
have told you how I secured my keepsake. How did
you acquire a limp?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By lying too long in one position,&rdquo; he replied, unconsciously
emulating her flippancy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear me! Why didn&rsquo;t you try some other sort
of lie?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because I was pinned down to the original statement
by a ton of rock.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should have thought that the noise would have
waked you up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That remark is a trifle too subtle for my dull
wits.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I watched you strolling about this morning,
and decided that you were walking in your
sleep.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t jump at conclusions. If I judged
you by your pointed style of speech, I might regard
you as a new species of porcupine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; she said approvingly. &ldquo;I was sure we&rsquo;d
become friends. I wish my father knew you. He
would like you.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Taking a line through you, may I say that the
liking would be mutual?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you, by any chance, thinking of visiting Patagonia?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>For some reason, hard to define, he was convinced
that Patagonia, though reported barren, would prove
a rather unsuitable place for an anchorite.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you interested in mines?&rdquo; she inquired, after
a pause.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What sort of mines, copper or silver?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Neither.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Really, you are most informing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; he said hurriedly. &ldquo;My mind
wandered for the moment. I was thinking how extraordinary
it was that a young lady should hit on my
profession so promptly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No marvel at all. Rocks fall mostly on miners.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;An excellent example of ratiocinative reasoning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t imagine you can crush me with a word
weighing a ton. Dad and I practise them on each
other. They keep our brains from rusting, a common
enough process on a ranch. Have you ever lived
on one?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He stirred uneasily. Evidently, Patagonia shared
certain characteristics with Colorado. Those absurdly
shrewd eyes of hers missed nothing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have I stuck another quill into you?&rdquo; she went
on. &ldquo;If so, it was an involuntary effort.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As it happens, I do live&mdash;I mean, I have lived<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>&mdash;on
a ranch. I own one; but it contains a gold
mine. So, you see, your divination is almost uncanny.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am still guessing why you are coming to South
America. Don&rsquo;t tell me if you prefer to make a mystery
of your intentions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you be vexed if I avail myself of your offer,
and remain silent?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Vexed? I shall be delighted. It is a positive joy
to meet a man who had rather appear uncivil than
coin a polite fib. The most truthful of men lie glibly
to girls. They think it is good for us. Now, I regard
you as a person who hates deceit in either man or
woman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He turned and stared at her fixedly. &ldquo;May I ask
how old you are?&rdquo; he said abruptly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nineteen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You talk like a woman of forty, and a wise one
at that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was grown-up at seven. At twelve I got that
crack on the head I told you of last night, when our
homestead was attacked and burnt by drunken Indians&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are there Indians of that sort in Patagonia?&rdquo; he
broke in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fifty-seven varieties&mdash;all bad. Some have souls,
I believe; others rank lower than the beasts. But
what have I said now?&rdquo; for he had sprung upright
as if in a great hurry to get away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Forgive me,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;I have just remembered
some important letters I must write before we
call at San Diego.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So,&rdquo; she communed, when he had vanished through
the companion-hatch, &ldquo;even Mr. John Darien Power
can prevaricate at times. But he is a nice man. I
wonder why some woman treated him badly. It must
have been a woman. If it were a man, he wouldn&rsquo;t have
run!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The two became firm friends. As the days passed,
and the <i>Panama</i> plodded south through tropic seas,
Power learned so many details of the girl&rsquo;s life that
he could have written her biography. Her father was
an Englishman, who found a wife in Los Angeles.
After being swindled by a nitrate company, he had the
good fortune to recover from the assets a tract of land
in the Chubut Territory of Patagonia. It contained
no nitrate; but the discovery that it would grow good
cattle came in the nick of time to save him from ruin.
His wife was killed in the Indian raid which had left
its disastrous record on his daughter; but Argentine
troops had exterminated the Araucanian tribe responsible
for the outrage, a rare event in that district,
and the ranch had prospered. Each year or eighteen
months Marguerite visited her maternal relatives in
Los Angeles, and worked hard at the university for a
term. By that device, it was evident, Sinclair salved
certain twinges of conscience for keeping her bright
intelligence pent in a Patagonian ranch. The two
hated these breaks in their home life. However, they
provided a middle way; so father and daughter made
the best of them.</p>

<p>Although the eastern route, via New York, was
quicker, the girl herself elected for the long sea voyage
down the Chile coast, and through the Straits of Ma<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>gellan.
She knew most of the ships plying in those
waters, and felt more at home in them.</p>

<p>She was a prime favorite on board the <i>Panama</i>&mdash;among
the men; her sharp tongue and amazing outspokenness
did not endear her to the women. Some
of them resented her popularity, and tried to snub
her, and the result was a foregone conclusion. Quite
unconsciously, Power caused one of these brief combats.
A pretty, but vapid, and rather rapid lady from
Iquique thought that a good-looking young man like
the American was devoting far too much time to Miss
Sinclair, and resolved to detach him.</p>

<p>She failed lamentably, and, in her pique, so far forgot
herself as to inquire sarcastically what magnetic
influence the girl exerted that she was able to keep
Power in constant attendance.</p>

<p>Marguerite surveyed her rival with bland unconcern.
&ldquo;You are mistaken,&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;He cares nothing
for women&rsquo;s society.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The other thought she saw an opening, and struck
viciously. &ldquo;So it would appear,&rdquo; she smirked.
&ldquo;You are the only woman on the ship he has spoken
to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. Odd, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Distinctly so. Perhaps he is one of those rare
mortals who really believe that beauty is only skin
deep.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How consoling that great and original thought
must be for you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For me? Why for me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because, like charity, beauty covers a multitude of
sins.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Someone overheard this passage at arms. The quip
held a barbed shaft which flew far, even unto Iquique,
and the Chilean merchant regained lost ground when
he heard of it by exclaiming, &ldquo;How true!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But, strive as she might, and did, Marguerite never
received any confidences from Power. They talked
about many things; but his past history remained a
closed volume. The long, hot days succeeded one another
with monotonous regularity. When the red cliffs
of Valparaiso appeared beneath the snow-crowned line
of the Andes, those two, perhaps, were the only people
on the ship who regretted that the voyage was at
an end.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So we part here,&rdquo; said the girl, as Power found
her waiting near the gangway to go ashore in the
tender.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;When you are older you will
realize that life consists largely of partings.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know that now,&rdquo; she said. She was wearing a
white double veil, which was her habit when in towns,
so he could not see that she was very pale. He was
aware of an irksome pause&mdash;a rare thing as between
Marguerite Sinclair and himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You go straight to your new steamer, I believe?&rdquo;
he went on, forcing the conversation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. And you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I drift into a hotel for a couple of days.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I cannot tempt you to visit my poor but
proud Patagonia?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I fear not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Goodby, Mr. Power.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She shook hands with him hurriedly, and joined the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
crush of passengers in the gangway. She moved with
the easy grace of one who lived much in the open
air. For the hundredth time she reminded him of
Nancy. He sighed. At last his seven years&rsquo; pilgrimage
had really begun!</p>

<h2><small>CHAPTER XIV</small><br />

THE WANDER-YEARS</h2>


<p>If this record were a story of romantic adventure,
it might well start from the moment Power set foot
in the hotel which a relative of an eminent French
actress used to keep in Valparaiso. He had not been
in the city many hours before a brutal assault on
a woman led him to intervene. During the resultant
scuffle he was robbed of his pocketbook, and, in addition
to a narrow escape from being knifed, he was informed
by a supercilious policeman that the whole
affair, including the screams of a female apparently
in fear of her life, had been cleverly engineered
for the express purpose of relieving him of his
money.</p>

<p>When settling his affairs at Bison he had arranged
that the bulk of his revenues should be lodged with his
New York bankers, to whom letters and communications
of every sort were to be sent. To provide against the
unforeseen&mdash;a word of wide significance when applied
to the vortex into which he was plunging&mdash;it was understood
that a cablegram in his name would be acted
on only if it bore the code-word &ldquo;Bido,&rdquo; a simple
composite of the first syllables of Bison and Dolores,
and, had it not been for the lucky chance that the bulk
of his available ready money, some five thousand dollars,
was safe in his room at the hotel, he might have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
been compelled to reveal his whereabouts to the bank
forthwith.</p>

<p>Then, a Chilean gentleman, impressed by the fact
that Power was an American, and therefore a millionaire,
tried to extract gold from him by the safer and
really more effective method of selling him a guano
island. Singularly enough, this second thief&rsquo;s pertinacity
opened up the narrow and hazardous path for
which Power was looking. The captain of a small
steamer engaged in the guano trade went out of his
way to warn the American that he was being exploited
by a scoundrel. Such disinterested honesty in a Chilean
was attractive. Some talk followed, and, three
days after arriving in Valparaiso, Power quitted that
lively city as a passenger on board the <i>Carmen</i>, bound
for islands in the south.</p>

<p>The friendly skipper had no inkling of his new acquaintance&rsquo;s
intentions. He thought that the se&ntilde;or
was veritably a speculator in guano, who, all the better-known
deposits off the coast of Peru being either taken
up or exhausted, was bent on exploiting fresh fields in
Chile. This much is certain. Had Captain Malaspina
realized that this well-spoken and pleasant-mannered
stranger meant to throw in his lot with the savage race
which infests the inhospitable islands and rock-strewn
channels of the wildest coast in the world, he would
have regarded him as a lunatic. He could never guess
that his own blood-curdling yarns of these outcasts
added fuel to the fire of Power&rsquo;s strange enthusiasm.
He believed that the Indians were cannibals. He had
seen them living and eating in the interior of a putrid
whale. He had found a five-year-old boy lying on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
rocks with his brains dashed out, and was told that
the child&rsquo;s father had shown his anger in that way because
the victim dropped some edible seaweed which the
man had been at some pains to gather. Mere words
could not describe the brutes. The worthy skipper always
spat when he spoke of them.</p>

<p>His gruesome stories beguiled a slow voyage while
the leaky boilers of the <i>Carmen</i>, iron steamship, of five
hundred tons, pushed her sluggishly through the long
rollers of the Pacific. Then a heavy sou&rsquo;westerly gale
sprang up, and the <i>Carmen</i> staggered for refuge into
the Corcovado Gulf, and thence plashed and wallowed
through the sheltered Moraleda Channel. To eke out
her scanty stock of coal she put into the estuary of
the Aisen River, where Malaspina bargained with Indians
for a supply of wood.</p>

<p>Power saw his opportunity, and seized it eagerly.
He asked to be put ashore for a couple of days in
order that he might study the natives at close quarters.
The friendly skipper was unwilling, arguing that
a tribe of monkeys would better repay investigation,
but ultimately yielded to pressure. There was really
no great risk, he knew, because Chilean gunboats had
taught these coast Indians to leave white men alone;
so Power was landed, his total equipment being a small
medicine chest, a hut, a folding bed, some few stores,
and a shotgun, with a hundred cartridges, all told. He
took more food than such a brief stay demanded; but
the necessity of placating the head men of the village
supplied a plausible excuse. A couple of silver dollars
proved an irresistible bribe to a Spanish-speaking Indian
who promised to guide him into the interior, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
a letter to the amazed skipper of the <i>Carmen</i> saved the
villagers from reprisals.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;I am sorry I was compelled to mislead you [he wrote];
but I mean to explore the Andes at this point, and I prefer
to set out on a crazy project without undergoing the protests
and dissuasion I should certainly have met with from
the kind friend you have proved yourself. If all is well
with you seven years from this date, write to me, care of
the National Bank, New York. I will surely answer.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>&ldquo;Seven years!&rdquo; shouted Malaspina, shaking a huge
fist at the silent hills. &ldquo;Seven devils! He is mad,
mad! There will be an inquiry by the American consul,
and I shall be accused of killing him. Holy Virgin!
What a fool I was to let him go alone!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was minded to flog an Indian or two, and thus
extract information; but calmer counsels prevailed.
After all, he had a letter proving that Power had left
the ship voluntarily. At first he resolved to report the
astounding incident on returning to Valparaiso, and
discussed the matter volubly with Jos&eacute;, second in command.
Jos&eacute; said, &ldquo;No. Let sleeping dogs lie. Those
foreign consuls are plaguy fellows. They get many
a poor man hanged just to please their governments.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Malaspina had been well paid, of course; so he decided
to hold his tongue, keeping the letter, in case&mdash;&mdash; Thus
was the trail lost. Power was buried alive.</p>

<p>The guide led him twenty miles up the valley of the
Aisen, and handed him over to the members of another
tribe, describing him as a harmless moon-gazer.
In a hovel lay an elderly Indian, shivering with fever.
Power dosed the quaking wretch with calomel and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
quinine, and performed a miracle. Thenceforth his
life was safe; as long as the few ounces of quinine and
calomel lasted, at any rate. He had landed in the
Chile region at the beginning of spring, and his nomad
hosts moved nearer the Andes when the weather improved,
taking him with them. Their barbarous
tongue included a number of Spanish words, and by
slow degrees he learned their comparatively small but
curiously inflected vocabulary. Once he could make
himself understood, the foundations of his mission were
laid securely. By sheer initiative, having no training
in such arts beyond the knowledge acquired by most
intelligent men, he taught them how to spin and weave
the long hair of the Chilean goat. He established some
principles of communal law. He showed them how to
use nitrate as a fertilizer. He experimented with
medicinal herbs when his own small store of drugs had
given out. He got them to build better huts, and adopt
some elementary principles of sanitation. Tillage and
crops broke down the migratory habit. Land was
cleared, and drained or irrigated as needed. For the
first time in its history, the tribe lived in permanent
dwellings. In a word, Power established a state.</p>

<p>Within four years he had elevated these apemen
and women to a standard so far above that of their
neighbors that his fame spread into unknown fastnesses
of the Cordillera. Among his adopted people he would
have been worshiped as a god if he had not sternly
repressed any such tendencies. But he could not stop
the growth of his reputation as a magician, and a well-planned
raid by another tribe brought about the slaughter
of a section of the community and his own capture.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span></p>

<p>He was reduced now to the direst misery. His captors,
some degrees cruder and more bestial than the
men he was governing, took him by forced marches
across a spur of the Andes, giving him food of such
revolting nature that he became deadly ill. At last they
were compelled to carry him, and, using such limited
reasoning faculties as they possessed, allowed him to
save his life by cooking and eating portions of animals
freshly killed. Their object in making him a
prisoner, he gathered, was to divert his magic to their
own district so that his incantations might increase
their herds. When he failed to accomplish this laudable
purpose offhand, they became violent, and threatened
to burn him alive. On the homeopathic principle,
an abnormally dry and scorching spring came to his
rescue. Some species of noxious insect, whose bite was
fatal to horses and cattle, multiplied exceedingly, and
the tribe lost half their stock. A wily candidate for
the chiefship spread the notion that the white god
had caused this misfortune, and that the person who
really ought to be burnt alive was the chief who counseled
the raid. This was duly done, and heavy rain
fell that night, effectually disposing of the insect
pests.</p>

<p>The new chief, who would have been an acquisition
to certain political circles in more temperate climes,
saw that, although he had scored heavily, the dangerous
wonder-worker might be associated with evils yet to
come; so, on his suggestion, Power was taken through
the mountains by a secret pass, and left on the eastern
slopes of the range to fare as best he might.</p>

<p>The Indians were afraid to gratify their instincts<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
by murdering him outright; but, seeing that he was absolutely
unarmed, and without a scrap of food in his
possession, there was no misunderstanding the malevolent
grin with which their leader pointed out the path
he must follow. These very aborigines, despite their
animal lore concerning edible roots, and their readiness
to dispute with vultures for a carrion meal, knew
that no man could traverse those leagues of foothills
without arms and a commissariat of some kind. No
semblance of a track existed. Power and his guards
stood on a scree of loose stones and shale not far below
the snow line, and well above the first precipitous
valley in which even the hardiest pines reached a stunted
growth. The steep hillside was covered with the strange
snow shapes known to Spanish South America as penitentes,
weird wraiths like sheeted ghosts, and more
than one broad track torn through these awesome sentinels
showed where avalanches of rocks and ice had thundered
down from the heights that very day.</p>

<p>Power looked out over the appalling vista of barren
hills and tree-choked ravines which lay in front.
In the direction shown by the Indian he saw a slight
depression in an otherwise unbroken ring of unscalable
mountains, and it was reasonable to assume that the
milk-white glacier stream flowing through a canyon a
thousand feet beneath must find its way to the sea
through that gap. It was so long since he had glanced
at a map of South America that he had only the vaguest
notion of his whereabouts. As a rough guess, beyond
those tremendous highlands lay the plains of Lower
Argentina&mdash;the black, wind-swept, semidesert pampas.
At the lowest calculation, he was three hundred and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
fifty miles from the Atlantic, and fifty of those miles
offered such difficulties to man&rsquo;s endeavor that well-equipped
expeditions had turned back time and again
from attempts to find new passes through the Andes
in that region.</p>

<p>To try and reach the eastern coast meant almost
certain death; but the scowling faces of the Indians
showed that the effort must be made, unless he was
prepared to fall under their weapons then and there.
The uncouth tongue he had acquired on the Trans-Andean
slope was not of much avail with his present
custodians; but, when he asked the leader of the party
for a spear, he was understood.</p>

<p>By nothing less, in Power&rsquo;s view, than the direct intervention
of Providence, the man was minded to treat
the matter as a joke, and handed over his own spear,
a nine-foot shaft of tough and limber hickory, tipped
with a flat blade of iron about eight inches in length
and two in width at its widest part. A stout shank was
gripped by the split wood, and strongly bound in its
socket with a thong of hide. Singularly enough, these
savages had never searched their prisoner&rsquo;s pockets.
Probably, they were afraid to touch him, lest he laid
some evil spell on them; so he was able now to produce
a silver dollar, which he gave with a smile, indicating,
at the same time, his willingness to purchase a couple
of strips of the dried meat carried by some members
of the escort.</p>

<p>This request was refused peremptorily, and a distinctly
threatening gesture warned Power that the parley
was at an end. He turned resolutely toward the
rising sun, and began his lonely and affrighting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
Odyssey. He admitted afterward that he knew what
fear meant during the first few strides across the broken
ground, because he was suspicious lest the Indians might
have planned to spear him from behind. Indeed, some
such barbaric pleasantry may have occurred to them.
A fierce clamor of talk broke out suddenly; but a swirl
of snow swept down from a neighboring glacier, and
even these hardy savages had no desire to be caught
on that dangerous scree in a snowstorm. So the hubbub
died away as quickly as it had arisen.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the snow did not fall so thickly as to
be actually blinding. The hapless fugitive could discern
his bearings, and he moved as speedily as possible
to a point he had already fixed on as being out
of the track of avalanches. He reached this landmark,
a hump of rock, and perforce remained in its shelter
till the weather cleared. During this vigil he heard
the dull roar and rumble of falling d&eacute;bris, and, when
the snow-shower ceased, he saw that two fresh lanes had
been plowed through the serried ranks of the penitentes.
Of the Indians there was neither sight nor
sound.</p>

<p>It was then about noon on a spring day. He had
not troubled to keep any reckoning of the calendar; but
he knew that the month was late October or early November.
So there still remained six or seven hours of
practicable daylight, and he resolved to push on
boldly, and reach a less perilous altitude before night
fell.</p>

<p>He had two vital problems to solve. The first was
the food difficulty; the second, to find a road where
road there was none. The awful solitudes of the higher<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
Andes and the dank forests which cumber the lateral
valleys are singularly devoid of animal and bird life.
It is a land of decay and death. The very hills disintegrate
so rapidly that rivers which flow into the
Pacific in one century may empty themselves into the
Atlantic in the next. The constant falling away of
precipices, and the luxuriant growth of trees and brushwood
amid a tangle of rotting timber, render continuous
advance by way of the ravines absolutely impossible.
Hence, his only chance of escape lay in
keeping to the highlands, trusting to luck and the lie of
the land when an occasional crossing of a canyon became
necessary in order to avoid doubling on his tracks
and being driven back to the white wilderness of the
inner chain.</p>

<p>Happily, he was better equipped than most men
for an undertaking which was almost comparable with
the plight of an explorer lost in the Arctic. Though
enfeebled by his recent illness, and already in need
of a meal, four years of exposure to hardships which
would have killed a weakling, and daily living in the
open in the worst of weather, had hardened his frame
and toughened his constitution to that degree of fortitude
with which Greek historians loved to invest
Mithridates Eupator. Moreover, he was suitably
clothed in skins, and his feet were incased in moccasins.
Above all, his was an equable heart. Death had hovered
near many a time and oft during those wild wander-years.
He had heard the very fluttering of its sable
pinions when he turned his back on the pitiless Indians;
but he was firmly resolved not to lose faith while he
could stand square on his feet. Time enough to lie<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
down and die when movement was no longer possible.
Meanwhile, he would struggle on.</p>

<p>Progress, of course, was slow. Every yard of the
way was difficult, every second yard hazardous. As
an alpenstock, the spear was invaluable. But for its
aid he would have slipped and fallen a dozen times
on that treacherous mountainside. After a couple
of miles of fairly straight going, he was faced by the
need of crossing to another range. Choosing a line
which seemed practicable, he climbed down a broken
rock face, plunged into the medley of fallen logs which
cumbered the nearer slope of the intervening canyon,
and ferried a torrent by the precarious bridge of a rotting
pine, the only one, among hundreds which had
fallen, long enough to reach the opposite bank, and so
slender and brittle at its apex that it crumbled beneath
him just as he sprang to safety on a rock slippery
with spray.</p>

<p>The climb to the open again was exhausting work.
Once he thought he was done for when an apparently
sound log snapped suddenly, and plunged him into a
dark and fearsome network of dead wood, so swathed
in soft and noisome fungus growths that he seemed to
be unable to find sure hold for either hand or foot.
Somehow, he clambered into daylight again, and found
himself clinging to the roots of a tree which throve
on the tangled husks of its ancestors. It took him
three hours to reach a height of five hundred feet,
at which point the treacherous forest belt yielded to
a firmer area covered by alpine moss.</p>

<p>Then, utterly worn out, and unequal to further effort
that day, he was thinking of gnawing some bulbs of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
resin which had exuded from the bigger firs, when he
caught sight of a small armadillo scuttling over the
rocks. It was the first living creature, save for an
occasional vulture, he had seen since leaving the snow-line.
The discovery brought a spurious energy, and he
dashed off in pursuit. The armadillo, which was far
removed from its natural habitat&mdash;probably owing to
the drought in the lowlands&mdash;ran very rapidly, and
was evidently making for a burrow. Indeed, Power
despaired of securing the creature when it headed for
a fissure in the ground. As a last resource, he hurled
the spear at it. The weapon turned in the air, fell
vertically, and buried its broad blade in the animal&rsquo;s
neck, striking the only vulnerable part of its body, since
the whole remaining structure was covered with a
strong, bony case of flexible plates.</p>

<p>The chances against any such haphazard casting of
a javelin proving successful were simply incalculable;
but Power took this piece of good fortune as further
proof that he was being befriended by Providence.
Leaving the armadillo where it had fallen, he searched
the crevices in which it was about to seek refuge, and
obtained some handfuls of dry moss. Then he gathered
a bundle of the driest sticks he could find, and,
by using a flint and steel, which, in his case, had long
ago superseded all other means of lighting a fire, was
soon enjoying a meal the like to which no chef in
Paris could have prepared that night. True, there
were but one course and one sauce; but the joint was
eatable, with something of a pork flavor, and the sauce
was ravenous hunger. Only the other day he told the
most famous of contemporary head waiters that roast<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
armadillo was vastly superior to sucking pig, at which
the eminent one smiled, realizing that his patron was
no gourmet.</p>

<p>Covering the remains of the feast with the creature&rsquo;s
own armor, which, as an extra precaution against vultures,
he weighted down with stones, Power arranged
a bed of moss under an overhanging rock, and lay down
to sleep. A wild storm of wind and rain raged during
the night; but he was merely awaked for a minute or
two by the unusual clamor, and slept soundly again,
despite the fury of the elements. At dawn he was
astir, and, after eating a few mouthfuls, tied the rest
of the small joints to the spear by their own sinews,
and began his march again.</p>

<p>As the armadillo supplied the only food he secured,
or could have secured, during six days of a most arduous
and nerve-racking advance through a country which
offered every sort of obstacle to the explorer, it is not
to be wondered at if Power came to believe that he
would yet emerge in safety from the perils confronting
him. But his rate of movement was exasperatingly
slow. On one day of the six he only succeeded in crossing
one particularly troublesome ravine. On another,
after skirting a mountain slope which positively bristled
with dangers, he found himself on a receding angle,
and was compelled to retrace his steps; although,
a dozen times already, he had been called on to exercise
every ounce of strength, every shred of resolution,
in order to cross appallingly difficult places which he
must now tackle again.</p>

<p>Still, he kept on, and that gap in the hills grew
ever wider and more distinct. He was gnawing the last<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
bone of the armadillo, and asking himself how much
longer it would be possible to maintain an unequal
struggle against the grim forces which sought to crush
him, when he had a stroke of luck. The Andes would
be even more impregnable than they are were it not
for an unusual geological formation which provides
broad and often practicable rock ledges along the walls
of the worst precipices. Farther north, in Peru, and,
to a less extent, in Chile, these roadways of Nature&rsquo;s
own contriving are much utilized by mountaineers and
their mules. When Power stumbled across one of them
after getting out of a specially steep and timber-clogged
ravine, he really did believe that his troubles
were lessening. He fancied he could discern faint signs
of others having passed that way, and he jumped to
the conclusion that those most unfriendly Indians knew
of this track, and could have piloted him to it in a
quarter of the time he had consumed. Obviously, it led
in the right direction. After climbing to a dizzy height,
it dipped again into the next valley, and, despite a
hazardous crossing of a mountain torrent, with complications
caused by a recent landslide, he discerned
another similar ledge on the opposite hill, and valiantly
made for it.</p>

<p>There could be no doubting now that he was entering
a more open country. The pass had broadened
into a valley, and a flat blue smear on the horizon told
of earth and sky meeting beyond a plain. The sight
spurred him to a frenzy of hope and effort. He pressed
on at far too rapid a pace, and, when hunger gripped
him once more, he strove to sate its pangs by munching
some dried berries, remnants of last year&rsquo;s autumn,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
which he gathered from a deciduous tree. He fancied,
judging by the taste, that they were not poisonous; but,
perhaps owing to his famished condition, they seemed
to induce a curious excitation of mind, accompanied by
dilated vision, which rendered colors entrancingly
bright and clear. In the valley opening out before
the descending ledge he imagined he could see patches
of pink blossom which reminded him of the apple orchards
of Colorado. He laughed aloud at the fantasy;
nevertheless, he tore on in desperate haste to get into
that attractive zone, where, surely, there must be animal
life, and, with it, the prospect of a meal. Overjoyed,
he sang as he went, rousing strange echoes. He,
who had dwelt among the heathen like another Xavier,
poured out his soul in the lilt and rhythm of &ldquo;Marching
Through Georgia&rdquo;! That stirring refrain had led
many a gallant heart to the &ldquo;crash of the cannonade
and the desperate strife&rdquo;; but never, surely, has it been
heard amid such surroundings. Cliff spoke to cliff.
Primeval nature was stirred, and answered his voice
in rude harmonies:</p>

<p class="poem">
&ldquo;Hurrah! Hurrah! We bring the jubilee!<br />
Hurrah! Hurrah! The flag that makes you free!<br />
So we sang the chorus from Atlanta to the sea,<br />
While we were marching through Georgia.&rdquo;<br />
</p>

<p>With a rush of wings and frantic clamor of screams,
a flock of upland geese (<i>Chlo&euml;phaga magellanica</i>) rose
from some hidden marsh beneath, and fled in ordered
phalanx to some distant sanctuary; whereupon Power
yelled that ecstatic &ldquo;Hurrah!&rdquo; anew. Here was life!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
Here was a world that smiled and was not dumb! He
must hurry, hurry, and enter into this Paradise!</p>

<p>Yet it came to pass, as so often happens in the
most commonplace phases of man&rsquo;s life, that, at the
very moment when the worst stage of the journey was
nearing its end, when he had accomplished the almost
impossible, when the leaping torrents of the hills
were merging into a stream which, if turbid and noisy,
bore some semblance to a river, he met with a disaster
that brought death even nearer than it had come at
any other crisis of his extraordinary career.</p>

<p>The track, rough as it was, offered comparatively
easy going. Now winding round the inner curve of
some huge fold in the hill, soon it would swing boldly
out across the face of a promontory of rock; while
passing one of these awesome precipices, which actually
jutted out so far beyond its own base that Power
could not see the river, though he could hear its
mighty voice roaring among bowlders, he fell. That is
to say, the broad ledge sank away beneath his feet,
and, after a vain spring toward a section which still
gripped the rocky wall, he fell with it.</p>

<p>He uttered no cry, made no plaint to Heaven. His
brain worked with inconceivable rapidity, and he knew
that he had been flung from a sheer height of well over
a hundred feet. Thus, unless he dropped into deep
water, and managed to retain his senses, either outcome
of the accident being wildly improbable, he must
be crushed into a pulp when he came to earth. He
petitioned the Most High that, if this was death, it
might be instantaneous, that his soul might go out of
its worn tabernacle in merciful oblivion, that he might<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
not be called on to lie, maimed and inert, watching
the gathering of vultures. Then some mighty hand
seemed to seize him in an irresistible grip, and he lost
consciousness.</p>

<p>When his senses returned, he found himself staring
blankly at a blue sky, a sky that shone gloriously
through a fairy lacework of branches of trees laden
with apple blossom; while a sweet and subtle scent was
pungent in his nostrils, and undoubtedly gave rise
to the quaint notion which instantly possessed him,
that he was already dead, and translated to a land
of everlasting spring. Then he knew that he was still
clothed in skins, that his bones ached, that he was hungry
and athirst; so this could be neither death nor
immortality. Suddenly, a savage face bent over him,
his head was lifted, and he was given some liquid. It
tasted like cider, and he drank copiously. Then his
brain reeled; for he was in no fit condition to withstand
a draft of singular potency, and again the mists
came, and he lapsed into the void.</p>

<p>He did not recover full consciousness that day. The
Indians, who had heard and been amazed at his singing,
saw him drop from the precipice, and ran to its
base, expecting to find a mangled corpse. But a tall
and slender pine had thrust its straight shaft into the
stout skin coat he wore, and had bent until it yielded
to the strain, and broke. Thus, he fell with enough
force to knock the wits out of him; but the major catastrophe
was averted, and the Indians were awed by
an incident which no patriarch of the tribe had witnessed
before, nor would ever see again if he attained
the age of Methuselah. The spear, which had left<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
Power&rsquo;s hand when he was in the air, had buried its
eight inches of blade in a fallen treetrunk, and had to
be hewed out with an ax.</p>

<p>These things the white necromancer learned afterward.
He found also that his vision of apple blossom
was no dream, but reality. Three centuries ago
Jesuit missionaries had crossed the Andes by that very
pass. They brought, as peace offerings to the Indians,
some of the fruit-trees and cereals of more favored
climes; but they were murdered without parley. Curiosity,
perhaps, led the savages to plant the trees and
seeds; the apples alone, finding a congenial soil, throve
marvelously. All that region abounds in sweet, wild
apples, from which the Indians concoct a fermented
liquor which they call <i>chi-chi</i>. Those same apples, and
the orgies of drunkenness to which they give rise, probably
account for the legend of a great city existing
within the untrodden depths of the Cordillera. But
there is no city&mdash;no trace of civilization save the
apples, a kindly memento of the unfortunate
Jesuits.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>And now Power began his regenerative work anew.</p>

<p>Thanks to the phenomenal style of his coming among
them, the savages spared his life; but their possession
of an almost unlimited stock of <i>chi-chi</i>, and the truculent
mood which strong drink induces, even in Indians,
led them, at first, to treat him as a Kok&oacute;-huinch&eacute;, or
&ldquo;white fool.&rdquo; Though their hunting-grounds were
hundreds of miles from the coast, and singularly remote
from the influence of white settlers, they were
aflame with vague resentment against the invaders, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
gladly made one of the hated race the butt of their
malevolent humor.</p>

<p>So Power, in self-defense, took to artifice. He discovered
that they possessed two kegs of gunpowder,
but owned no guns. He learned, too, that once there
had been three kegs, but a careless experiment with one
had removed a chief and his family. With some difficulty,
and only by tickling their imagination by promising
an exhibition of magic, he obtained some of the
powder, and, on a dark night, electrified the community
by a display of fireworks. Catharine wheels and Roman
candles achieved wonders among the foothills of
the Andes. From that instant his supremacy was established.
A squib or two enforced edicts; a rocket set
a constitution squarely on its feet. In less than three
years he had become the Indians&rsquo; trusted guide and
teacher. The day came when the store of powder was
almost gone; yet he was strong enough to prohibit the
manufacture of that season&rsquo;s supply of <i>chi-chi</i>.</p>

<p>But there was one thing he could not do. He could
not calm these wild people&rsquo;s frenzy when a hunting
party came in hot haste from the plains and announced
that a cavalcade of white men was forcing a passage
along the river, being evidently bent on penetrating
the valley of the apple-trees.</p>

<p>Power was asked to repel this invasion by black
art; failing which, the Araucanians decided to massacre
the explorers in a neighboring canyon. He had not the
least doubt as to the success of the scheme. He knew
the natural difficulties of the place. The upper end
could be barricaded, the lower blocked by spearmen
hidden in the dense vegetation, and every intruder<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
caught in the trap would be battered to death by boulders
flung from the crests of opposing precipices.</p>

<p>Very reluctantly the Indians allowed him to act as
their ambassador. By sheer force of will he bore down
opposition, and was taken to a point whence the smoke
of campfires was visible above the trees. It was hard
to say whether the faith his friends placed in him was
stronger than their fear and loathing of the white
strangers; but he exacted a promise that, if he persuaded
the members of the expedition to retreat, they
would not be molested. Oddly enough, neither he nor
the Indians gave a thought to any other possible development.
These savages believed that the white god
who had dropped upon them from the skies would never
leave them, and Power himself had almost forgotten the
existence of the outer world. Most certainly, he paid
no heed to the fact that his seven years of expiation
were nearly sped. He was happy among these simple
people. In his way, he was a king, and the habit of
ruling had become second nature.</p>

<p>By chance, that day he carried the spear which had
been his faithful ally in crossing the Andes, and a weird
and barbarous figure he must have presented when he
walked into an almost unguarded camp which had been
set up for a few hours on the right bank of the river.
Clothed in skins, his face bronzed to a deep brown by
constant exposure to the elements, his hair falling over
his shoulders, and a long beard sweeping to his breast,
he looked a veritable wild man of the woods.</p>

<p>A halfbreed peon who was the first to see him
whipped out a revolver, and shouted a warning; but
Power held his spear crosswise above his head, show<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>ing,
by this Indian sign, that he came in peace, and he
was permitted to approach.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is your leader?&rdquo; he asked in Spanish.</p>

<p>The peon seemed to be vastly astonished; but he
turned to a tall, thin, elderly man who had dived out
of a tent at his cry, and now strode forward.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where have you come from?&rdquo; he said; but his
speech betrayed him, and Power added to the sensation
he had already caused by saying:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are no Spaniard, at any rate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good Lord!&rdquo; cried the other. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an Englishman!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Next thing to it, an American,&rdquo; said Power.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is your name, and how do you happen to
be in this outlandish place?&rdquo; was the bewildered
demand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am here to explain all that, and more. Are you
the head of this expedition?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, what about discussing matters in that tent of
yours?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come right along,&rdquo; said the stranger, leading the
way.</p>

<h2><small>CHAPTER XV</small><br />

THE NEW LIFE</h2>


<p>Nearly seven years had elapsed since Power had
either seen a man of his own race, or heard civilized
speech. During all that time, save when he spoke aloud
in self-communing, or hummed the half-remembered
words of a song, he had neither uttered, nor read, nor
written a word of English. One literary treasure, indeed,
had come his way, and he made good use of it.</p>

<p>Some men of the tribe, digging one day for truffles,
broke into a cave, in which there was a skeleton.
Among the bones, wrapped in soft leather and parchment,
the Indians found a book, which they brought
to their white leader. It was an illuminated Book of
Hours, or &ldquo;Hor&aelig; Beat&aelig; Mari&aelig; Virginis,&rdquo; written in
Latin and Spanish, and, as Power ascertained subsequently,
the work of an Italian of the fifteenth century.
No more beautiful example of the exquisite classical
Renaissance period could be produced by the Vatican
library. The character in the figures and naturalness
in the landscapes bespoke a ripe art, and many
of the vellum pages were bordered by the solid frame
which gives full scope to the artist&rsquo;s fancy by its facilities
for the introduction of medallions, vignettes,
twisted Lombardic vines, cupids, fawns, colored gems,
and birds of brilliant plumage. Veritably, this
&ldquo;Hor&aelig;&rdquo; was more precious than if its leaves were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
of solid gold; its value to Power in those lonely hours
was of a spring in the desert to a parched traveler.</p>

<p>Despite such an invaluable stimulus to his mind, however,
it was almost with difficulty, and certainly with
marked hesitancy, that he was able now to arrange the
words of a sentence in their ordered sequence, and often
he found his tongue involuntarily lending an Indian
twist to idiomatic expressions. But his labored utterance
was either not so marked as he imagined, or
his host was so surprised at meeting a white man so
far from civilization that he could not repress his
own excitement. At the outset, too, the instinct of
hospitality helped to relieve the tension.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can I offer you anything in the way of refreshment&mdash;some
whisky, or tea, or a cigar?&rdquo; came the courteous
inquiry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A cigar, by all means. I have not smoked one for
so long a time that I have forgotten what it is like.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is pretty evident you have been living among
the Indians,&rdquo; said the other, passing him a cigar-case.
&ldquo;How in the world did you contrive to get lost in
these parts? You did not come through Patagonia, I
fancy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Power took thought before answering. Some half-atrophied
emotion stirred within him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Patagonia? Is this country Patagonia?&rdquo; he said
at last.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. Do you mean to say you don&rsquo;t know that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had a notion that it was the Argentine. My Indian
friends invariably speak of the white inhabitants
as Argentinos.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But how did you get here?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By crossing the Andes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;With a party?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, alone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His questioner whistled. &ldquo;By Jove!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;you
had your nerve with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t help myself. I was a prisoner in the
hands of a Trans-Andean tribe, and they turned me
adrift. I had to win through somehow, or die.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your name, anyhow?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;John Darien Power.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mine&rsquo;s Sinclair&mdash;George Sinclair. Well, Mr.
Power, this is a fortunate meeting for both of us. You
could never have reached the coast if you had not fallen
in with just such an outfit as mine, because there are
the devil&rsquo;s own breeds of Indians prowling about the
last hundred and fifty miles of this river. Luckily,
they dare not attack forty well-armed men; but, if
looks count, they are willing for the job should an
opportunity offer. We simply couldn&rsquo;t secure a guide;
so decided to follow the river all the way, especially as
it made transport fairly easy, except at the rapids.
Now you, on the other hand, can tell us just what we
want to know. Is the stream practicable much farther?
What sort of country lies between this point and the
snow-line?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I can tell you those things, and a good deal
more. What is the object of your expedition?
Gold?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sinclair laughed rather constrainedly. &ldquo;I suppose
that is the bedrock of the proposition,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;A
bit of science, a bit of prospecting, a last glimpse at a
country which is not marked on any map before I leave<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
Patagonia for good&mdash;there you have the scheme in a
nutshell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you willing to turn back now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. Why should we? We have come close on
three hundred miles; another fifty, or less, should see
us close to the frontier of Chile.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you may sacrifice your lives.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No Indians can stop us&mdash;let me assure you of that,
straight away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you let me mark your maps? I can supply
every detail with sufficient accuracy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Allow me to suggest that I am a business man, Mr.
Power, and I mean this expedition to pay its way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! It is gold you really have in mind, then?
But there is no gold.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now you are talking nonsense. We have found it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have found alluvial gold. There are few fast-running
streams in the world which do not contain
gold in that form. The denudation of the Andes is so
extraordinarily rapid that it would be a singular fact
if this river did not yield float gold. But the metal
is not, and cannot be, present in paying quantities.
The primary sources of gold are reefs, either in quartz
or in metalliferous veins of galena and the various
pyrites. There are none of these in the lower Andean
range, which is composed almost exclusively of crystalline
schist with a slight blend of basalt. I am a mining
engineer, Mr. Sinclair, and I know what I am talking
about. If you could put the entire southern Cordillera
through a mill, you would not secure a pennyweight
of gold to the ton.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sinclair, of course, could not appreciate the remark<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>able
way in which Power&rsquo;s tongue loosened in dealing
with the familiar jargon of his profession. For the
time he was far more concerned with what he deemed
a real marvel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A mining engineer, and your name is Power!
Surely you can&rsquo;t be the Mr. Power who sailed from
San Francisco to Valparaiso on the <i>Panama</i> seven years
ago?&rdquo; he cried.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, excuse me, there must be some mistake. My
daughter, Marguerite Sinclair, who was on board that
vessel, spoke of a Mr. Power; but he was a young man.
Of course, time does not stand still for any of us; but
this Mr. Power would now be thirty-five, or thereabouts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is my age.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thirty-five?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sinclair bent forward and peered into his visitor&rsquo;s
eyes; it was difficult to detect any play of expression
in the bearded face. &ldquo;Are you really the man my
daughter met on that steamer?&rdquo; he asked, and there
was a note of solemnity, almost of awe, in his voice.
This anchorite seemed nearer sixty than thirty-five.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I remember her perfectly&mdash;a charming girl.
She had suffered some injury to her face during an
attack by Indians on her father&rsquo;s ranch. Of course,
you are her father?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. But, tell me, Mr. Power&mdash;have you any notion
of the extraordinary appearance you present?
You force me to be blunt. You look like a man nearly
twice your age.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lend me a scissors and a razor, and I shall remove
a decade or two. Remember, I have lived as an Indian
for seven years.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do more than that. I can give you some clothes
and boots. God bless my soul! how surprised Meg will
be! I recollect now she told me that her Mr. Power
walked with a limp. But it&rsquo;s a far cry to Carmen.
I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Carmen, did you say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Power had suddenly recalled the name of the stuffy
little tramp on which he set forth from Valparaiso.
What memories crowded in on him, what a record of
suffering and achievement! Seven years! He knew
now that his pilgrimage was ended. The great world
had thrown wide its gates again. He could go back
to his own country, his own people. His sacrifice had
been accepted. He was assoilized. He thought of his
mother, of Nancy, and tears glistened in his eyes.
He believed that some lesion had been lifted off his brain.
He looked at the great facts of existence with a new
and saner vision. He almost heard a vibrant and majestic
voice saying to his spirit, &ldquo;Go, and sin no more!
Thy faith hath made thee whole!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He rose, and was dimly aware that Sinclair was
pressing him to stay. There was so much to discuss
yet, so many vital matters to weigh and debate; but
he managed to explain that he must depart now, and
would return later.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t understand that you are here on sufferance,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;I had to stretch my domination
to the utmost&mdash;and I am a king among these Indians<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>&mdash;to
stop them from attacking you. Your life, and
the lives of every man in your party, are not worth
a day&rsquo;s purchase if my influence is weakened. I cannot
tell what evil counsel may be given to these wild
folk in my absence. If I show myself, and assure them
that I am safe, and that you mean to retreat almost
at once, they will be satisfied, and bloodshed will be
averted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sinclair glanced at him curiously, but did not seek
further to prevent his immediate departure.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must act as you think best, Mr. Power,&rdquo; he
said amicably; &ldquo;but I certainly cannot promise to retreat
merely because a few wretched Indians bar the
path.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will convince you, never fear,&rdquo; came the prompt
assurance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I am not the only skeptic. There are others
to consult. I have two partners in this enterprise, and
one of them is a mining expert.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Leave everything to me, and make no forward move
till I come back. You can expect me in a couple of
hours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He could say no more. He was choking. It was a
mere pretense that he must conciliate the Indians, who,
he knew, were watching every move in the camp with
the eyes of eagles. What he really feared, in that moment
of revulsion and self-enlightenment, was that he
might break down and cry like a child.</p>

<p>He strode away, aflame with the fire of longing for
communion with his fellow-men. The tumult of emotion
evoked by contact with the expedition startled
and dismayed him; but he had not gone two hundred<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
yards up the valley before a sibilant hiss restored his
scattered wits. He was passing an Indian outpost,
and the faithful creatures were warning him of their
presence. He signed that he was going to the village,
and passed on. He had seen no one. Not a leaf moved
among the trees; but the watchers were there, and would
remain.</p>

<p>Much against the grain, though there was no help
for it, he pacified the head men of the tribe by the statement
that he must remain in the encampment that night;
indeed, he did not purpose leaving the invaders until
they had turned on their tracks. He dared not risk
telling his &ldquo;subjects&rdquo; that he meant to abandon his
empire. Their fierce passions were easily aroused, and
a prompt massacre of Sinclair and his followers would
be the certain result of a fanatical outbreak. Entering
his hut, he picked up the &ldquo;Hor&aelig;.&rdquo; As he did so, a
wave of sentiment shook him, because he thought of the
poor Spanish priest who had brought that precious
volume from C&aacute;diz or Barcelona, and, perchance, gazed
at it with eyes glazing in death while he lurked,
wounded and starving, in the cave where he had sought
shelter from the pitiless savages. Now, if God willed,
it might cross the Atlantic again.</p>

<p>He opened the book haphazard, and read:</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>In manus tuas, Domine, commendo spiritum
meum!</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then he sank on his knees, and prayed; for, if ever
man had placed soul and body in the keeping of the
Almighty, he had.</p>

<p>That evening, master of himself, and ever recovering
facility of speech, he reasoned with Sinclair and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
two Spaniards who had joined in the adventure. One,
a Se&ntilde;or Felice Gomez, though posing as an authority
on mines, had to admit that his knowledge was that of
the company director and well-informed amateur. They
were inclined to scoff at Power&rsquo;s predictions of disaster;
but he wound up with an argument which proved
irresistible.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How much has this enterprise cost you?&rdquo; he
asked.</p>

<p>Sinclair answered readily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have put up twenty thousand paper dollars<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">*</a>
for expenses,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;My share is ten thousand,
and my friends stand in five thousand each.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_A_1" id="Footnote_A_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_1"><span class="label">*</span></a> A paper dollar is worth about 40 per cent. of the gold dollar.</p></div>

<p>&ldquo;Would you be satisfied if you got your money
back, with a profit of one hundred per cent?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;According to you, Mr. Power, and almost you convince
me, we shall lose every penny.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, assuming the profit I have named, would
such return on your capital send you home well
content?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Speaking for myself, it would.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Spaniards grinned amiably. As a conceit, the
notion appealed to them. They were not poor men;
but had embarked on the quest largely to sate their
curiosity with regard to the unexplored reaches of the
Chubut River.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; said Power. &ldquo;I give your syndicate my
personal undertaking to pay the sum of forty thousand
dollars when we reach any place where there is
a bank with a New York agent. I really mean what
I say,&rdquo; he went on, seeing the blank incredulity writ<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>ten
on three faces. &ldquo;I am rich enough to table that
offer without the slightest chance of failing to make
good. Even though I die on the way to the coast, you
will have my written undertaking, which will be honored
by my bankers. If I survive the journey, a cablegram
will convince you of my financial standing. Naturally,
you will ask why I behave so generously. Well,
there are three reasons: Were it not for your presence
here, I might never have had a chance of returning
to civilization; so I am disposed to pay liberally for
your safe escort, which, to my thinking, has been sent
by Providence in my special behalf. That, in itself,
should suffice as an explanation. But the remaining
motives are almost equally strong. I am sure you are
rushing to certain death if you advance another mile
up the valley; but, supposing, as you imagine, that
your guns open the path, it will be across the dead bodies
of a people whom I have learned to like, and among
whom I have passed three not unhappy years. Very
well! I purchase their lives. All I demand to seal the
bargain is your promise to start downstream at daybreak,
taking me with you; but leaving here all the
pieces of iron, knives, nails, and such like articles you
can spare from your equipment. The Indians will find
and value them. They have no knowledge of metallic
ores. There are hardly any to be found in this locality.
It is a dead land, mere shale and rock and
crumbling earth, devoid of the riches which alone would
make it habitable. What do you say? If you agree
to my terms, give me a pen and paper. I suppose I
still can write, though I have not held a pen during
seven years.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man who could tame, and partly civilize, two
Indian tribes was not like to fail when called on
to subjugate men of his own or a kindred race. The
triumvirate yielded. Next day, when the canoes had
gone ahead, Power bestrode one of the dozen horses
which accompanied the expedition. The rearguard set
off at a canter, since a rolling down ran for eight
miles to the first portage. As Power rode away with
his new friends a long drawn-out, shrill wailing came
from the forest. The Indians understood then. Their
territory was left unspoiled; but they had lost their
wonder-worker. Had they but known it, the &ldquo;white
fool&rdquo; drew his hand across his eyes to clear away the
tears.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>For three weeks the horsemen and canoes followed the
windings of a river the waters of which were never
turbid or blue, but emerald green, except during occasional
sunsets, when they became a vivid crimson.
Then the party reached Port Madryn, whence a small
steamer took its chief members to Carmen, in the Rio
Negro Territory. The Spaniards hailed from that
place, and Sinclair, who had sold his Chubut ranch,
had left his daughter with friends there. There was
no cable available; but, by this time, Sinclair and his
partners would as soon have distrusted an archbishop&rsquo;s
word as Power&rsquo;s. Each day he reverted more and more
to type; yet he lost nothing of the dignity and air of
reposeful strength which his wanderings had conferred.
So, when he gave written orders for the various sums
due on his bond, they were accepted with the confidence<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
which would have been shown in the certified checks of a
state bank.</p>

<p>The vessel had to steam several miles up the Rio
Negro (the river is called &ldquo;black&rdquo;; but it is green as
the Chubut) before touching the wharf at Carmen.
News of their coming had preceded them, though no
mention had been made of Power, and it was vastly
amusing to Sinclair when his daughter, after embracing
him affectionately, turned and held out her hand
to the brown-skinned stranger.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Welcome to Patagonia, Mr. Power!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;I
was sure you would come to us some day; though I was
told in Valparaiso, three years ago, that you were lost
utterly in the depths of the Andes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you have not forgotten me?&rdquo; was all that Power
could find to say; though he flushed with pleasure at
this prompt recognition.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Forgotten you? Didn&rsquo;t I tell you I should know
you again in twenty years?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am glad to have survived even a third of the time
in your memory.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, please don&rsquo;t test it so severely again. What
have you been doing to yourself? You look like an
Indian.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Meg,&rdquo; broke in her father, &ldquo;I hoped that
four months&rsquo; residence in a Spanish household would
give you a more polite way of expressing yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Power takes that as a compliment, I am sure.
When we parted he was running away from the flesh-pots
of Egypt&mdash;or was it Bison? Evidently he has
succeeded in his object. He is lean as a herring.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
Where did you find him, Dad? Ruling a tribe of Araucanians,
I&rsquo;m certain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I hadn&rsquo;t found him, you would never have seen
me again, Girly. But we can&rsquo;t tell the horrible story
here on the quay. Take me to a long cane chair, and
mix me a whisky and soda. That wretched little tub
of a steamer tried to stand on its head last night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>One thing was evident. Power had convinced his
companions of the real danger they had escaped. He
had said no word concerning the canyon, while it constituted
the Indians&rsquo; defense; but it was betraying no
secret to make clear its perils during the journey to
the coast.</p>

<p>Next day, after breakfast, Sinclair drew him aside,
and handed him a sealed envelop.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Meg objects strongly to the arrangement we entered
into, in so far as it affects me,&rdquo; he explained.
&ldquo;She insists that I return your draft. I was turning
the matter over in my own mind, and I was not altogether
happy about it. Now I see that she is right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But both of you happen to be wrong,&rdquo; said Power.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not. Why in blazes should <i>you</i> pay <i>me</i>?
The boot is on the other leg. I owe you my life. Look
here, Power, the thing can&rsquo;t be argued. If it pleases
you to let my Spanish friends have their share of the
money, I&rsquo;ll not say a word, one way or the other; but
I&rsquo;ll see you cremated before I cash that draft!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me defray your out-of-pocket expenses, at any
rate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a centavo! If you say anything more about
it, I&rsquo;ll get an actuary to calculate my life value, and
worry you till you accept a settlement in full.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Women invariably take a distorted view of a matter
like this,&rdquo; protested Power.</p>

<p>Sinclair laughed. &ldquo;Oh, you have discovered that,
have you?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Well, I can&rsquo;t afford to quarrel
with Meg, and her heart is set on your tearing up the
draft, Mr. Power.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girl herself never mentioned the incident; but,
when next they met, Power felt that a slight constraint
of which he was sensible in her manner that morning
had gone completely.</p>

<p>Sinclair&rsquo;s affairs in Patagonia were settled before
he set out on that long trek into the wilds; but there
still remained some odds and ends of business which
detained him nearly a month in Carmen. During those
placid days Power and Marguerite Sinclair were together
constantly. They boated on the Rio Negro,
fished in its swift current, rode long miles over the
gray and treeless pampas. The girl was a woman now,
and, were it not for that cruel disfigurement of one
side of her face, a singularly attractive one. She was
never dull, never at a loss for a new and original turn
to the old topics. Her interests covered a surprisingly
wide range. Whether singing Spanish songs to her
own accompaniment on a guitar, or discoursing learnedly
on the habits of the migratory wild-fowl with
which Patagonia abounds, she never failed to acquit
herself with vivacious charm. Indeed, the recluse of
the Andes could not have been more favored by fortune
in the choice of a companion. With sure touch,
and a happy blend of raillery and sympathy, she led
him back to the gracious intimacies of every-day existence.
A keen and discriminating reader of contem<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>porary
literature, she set herself the congenial task
of filling the immense gap of the years lost out of this
remarkable man&rsquo;s life. On his part, so avid was he of
the joys of regained citizenship of the world that he
was blithely unaware of the place she filled in his
thoughts until the day of parting.</p>

<p>He had traveled with father and daughter to Buenos
Aires, whence he cabled to New York, and was placed
in possession of ample funds. The Sinclairs were bound
for England, and their steamer sailed almost immediately,
and the vessel which would take him to New
York was timed to start next day.</p>

<p>They lunched together in the H&ocirc;tel de l&rsquo;Europe,
Plaza Victoria, and Sinclair had left the younger people
for a few minutes while interviewing a lawyer who
had charge of certain financial matters in the Argentine.
Some chance remark led Power to realize that
Marguerite Sinclair&rsquo;s bright personality would soon be
merged with yesterday&rsquo;s seven thousand years, and the
knowledge darkened his new-born optimism as the black
portent of a tornado blots out the blue of a summer
sky.</p>

<p>It was hardly surprising that the discovery came thus
tardily. The philosophical habit of mind induced by
constant association with fatalistic Indians was not
to be cast off like a disused garment. When each day
resembled its predecessor, when the needs of the hour
rendered care for the morrow an additional burden,
he had trained himself to live, and almost to think, according
to savage ethics, and it was with a positive
shock that he awoke to the fact that before many hours
had sped he would be alone. But, once it had entered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
his soul, the leaven worked rapidly. They were talking
in conventional strain about her father&rsquo;s plans for the
future, which centered around a small sporting estate
in Derbyshire, once owned by his family and now in
the market, when Power rose suddenly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you have finished luncheon,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;come with
me into the gardens across the plaza. We&rsquo;ll leave word
of our whereabouts with the hotel people, so that Mr.
Sinclair will not think I have abducted you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She paled slightly, and seemed to hesitate, but only
for an instant. &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; she said, dropping the
white double veil she always wore in public.</p>

<p>Power rather looked for some biting retort when
he spoke of abducting her, and her unexpected meekness
was somewhat disconcerting. Each was tongue-tied,
and they walked away together in silence. A
good many eyes followed them as they left the hotel,
for the girl&rsquo;s slender, lissome figure and noticeably elegant
carriage would have attracted the attention of
more censorious critics than a gathering of Spanish-Americans,
while the wealth of brown hair which
crowned her shapely head and column-like neck was
adequately set off by a smart hat. Power, too, evoked
some comment. People who saw him for the first time
invariably asked who he was. A man who has twice
established an empire, even among Indians, cannot possibly
lack distinction, no matter how effectually the
outfitting tailor may democratize him.</p>

<p>They entered the gardens, and Power led Marguerite
to a seat under a tree whose spreading branches,
broad-leafed and flower-laden, supplied grateful shade.
If he could have peered beneath that heavy veil, he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
would have seen that his companion was obviously ill
at ease; but there was no trace of nervousness in her
voice when she said, with a laugh:</p>

<p>&ldquo;This, I suppose, is the local Garden of Eden.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; he inquired.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because we are reclining under a Paradise tree.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see any serpents, and I cannot bring myself
to regard you as either a cherub or a seraph.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How unkind of you! Here have I been behaving
angelically all day, just because you will soon see the
last of me, and that is my reward.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe the sex of angels is a matter of fierce
dispute in certain circles. I wouldn&rsquo;t dare form an
opinion, and, just now at any rate, I am vexed by a
different problem. If this tree is really the tree of
the knowledge of good and evil, its influence will be
helpful, because we should be moved to candor. I
brought you here to ask you some questions of vital
importance to myself. Are you promised to any man
in marriage?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. Is it likely?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Not often did the bitter consciousness of her marred
beauty rise thus bluntly to her lips; but she blurted
it out now involuntarily. In this supreme moment it
came as a protest against the edict of the gods. Even
while she trembled in the belief that a happiness she
had not dared to think of sanely was about to be vouchsafed
to her, she could not restrain her terror lest the
disillusionment of her scarred face might cost her
the love of the one man on earth she wanted to marry.
It was the heartfelt cry of a woman denied her birthright.
&ldquo;Male and female created he them.&rdquo; The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
sorry trick of fate which had tarnished the fair tabernacle
that enshrined so many gifts had never before
exhibited its true malice. In a word, Marguerite Sinclair
was a woman, and the great crisis of her life
had found her unprepared and nearly hysterical.</p>

<p>Power, of course, was splendidly deaf to her satire
and its cause.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should say it was the most likely thing imaginable,&rdquo;
he replied. &ldquo;I wish&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; He broke off
abruptly. &ldquo;You and I should have no reservations,&rdquo;
he went on, after a pause, &ldquo;and it would not be quite
honest if I voiced the banal notion I had in mind. Yet
I must tell you something of my history. You know,
I suppose, that I am going to ask you to marry me;
but, before you answer, you must hear the plea, the
defense, of a man who committed a crime and had to
pay the penalty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You committed no crime, Derry,&rdquo; and the girl&rsquo;s
utterance was so low and sweet that it swept through
his inmost being like a chord of exquisite music. Some
seconds elapsed before he understood that she had used
a name which could not have come to her knowledge
without a far more intimate acquaintance with his past
life than he believed possible.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Derry!&rdquo; he repeated blankly. &ldquo;How have you
found out that those I once held dear called me
&lsquo;Derry&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She forced herself to speak calmly; though her hands
were clenched in sheer physical effort to quell the riot
in heart and brain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not as other women,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;so I say
shamelessly that I loved you practically from the hour<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
we first met. Do you remember? You looked at me,
and then turned your eyes away resolutely, lest you
should hurt my feelings by seeming to gaze at my
scarred features. I knew that night that you were
a man scourged by the wrath of Heaven, and my sympathies
went out to you; for, in my own small way,
I realized what you felt. But your affliction was of
the spirit, and mine of the flesh, and I could afford to
laugh at my malaise except&mdash;except on an occasion like
this, when a man says he wants to marry me, but says
nothing of love. No, please! Hear me out. I am
really answering your question, in a woman&rsquo;s way,
perhaps, but candidly, with a frankness that should
blight romance. When we parted at Valparaiso, my
thoughts dwelt with you. You are the one man I have
ever cared for, in that way. During these weary years
I have hugged the delusion that some day you would
tell me that you loved me. Well, I admit that love
was implied when you spoke of marriage; but you
have often been annoyed or amused by my distorted
method of looking at things, and you should not resent
it now when it happens to describe the situation
exactly&mdash;because you yourself almost began by saying
that you wished we had met before another woman
came into your life. Yes, I know&mdash;at any rate, I can
guess&mdash;why you were buried alive for seven years. My
action may sound contemptible; but a woman in love
does not stop to weigh niceties of behavior. When I
could get no news of you by other means, I wrote
to a school friend at Denver. Among the people she
met when making inquiries were a Dr. Stearn and a
Mr. Benson. They did not tell her much; but femi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>nine
gossip is far-reaching, and sometimes it probes
deeply. I know you loved Nancy Willard. I know
how you were separated from her. I know you met her
again in Newport. I know you blamed yourself for
the death of your mother. I know that your friends
thought you were mad, but pitied you, because yours
was a grievous plight. You see now how I peeped and
pried into your life. Oh! it was mean and despicable
of me. It is not for <i>you</i> to plead and make excuse.
That is <i>my</i> wretched task. Is it any sort of vindication
to tell you that my heart ached because of that
far-away look ever in your eyes while we voyaged south?
You have not forgotten that I said you resembled a
man walking in his sleep? Well, I wanted to find out
what sort of folly or suffering had induced that trance.
My poor little heart sang with joy when you stepped
ashore at Carmen, and I saw that your obsession had
gone, that you had come to life again, that no pale
specters stood between us. Now you have heard my
confession, it is for <i>you</i> to take time&mdash;before&mdash;you
commit yourself&mdash;to vows&mdash;which you may regret.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was as much as she could do to utter those concluding
words. The tears she might not repress were
stealing silently down her cheeks, and small, dark
patches showed where the tightly drawn veil touched
the corners of her mouth. The hotel porch was visible
between two clumps of tropical shrubbery, and, when
a mule-drawn street-car moved out of the way, Power
saw Sinclair&rsquo;s tall, thin figure standing in the doorway.
Evidently, his glance was searching the gardens
for the missing pair, and the departure of the tram
rendered them visible. He raised a hand, and opened<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
and closed it twice. Power waved comprehension, and
Sinclair vanished. Perhaps he had a shrewd notion
of the subject of their talk, and was minded not to
disturb them till the last moment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I take it your father means that we still have
ten minutes at our disposal,&rdquo; said Power.</p>

<p>The girl nodded. If she spoke then, she would have
screamed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have relieved me of a highly disagreeable
task,&rdquo; he went on composedly. &ldquo;Of course, I accept
none of the unkind and unjust strictures you passed
on yourself. This has been a strange wooing; but it
is the best apology for the real thing I can contrive in
the conditions. Some day, soon, I shall take you in
my arms and tell you that I love you. When that day
dawns, I shall be hindered by no ghosts; none other,
that is, than a lurking fear lest such a wreck of a man
may not be deemed worthy of the pure, sweet love of
a woman like you. Good God! Can it be possible that
so great a happiness is entering into my broken
life?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then the delirium of joy vanquished the girl&rsquo;s fears,
and she contrived to say haltingly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Derry, do you really care for me? Do you think
that such a poor scarecrow as I can make you forget
all that you have endured?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He laughed, and the blithe ring of his mirth was so
eloquent of his real feelings that the blood raced in
her veins like quicksilver.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We must begin by refusing to call each other hard
names,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;In truth, I regard myself as a
tolerably compact wreck, while &lsquo;scarecrow,&rsquo; as applied<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
to you, would make a cat laugh. Suppose we stick to
&lsquo;Derry&rsquo; and &lsquo;Meg&rsquo; until the wonder passes, and we
venture among those endearing terms in which our
language is so rich. But, if you must have my opinion
about your face&mdash;if you won&rsquo;t be happy till you
get it&mdash;I want to tell you now that before I kiss your
lips I shall kiss that dear, scarred cheek, because I
know well that, by God&rsquo;s providence, when the Indians
thrust you into the flames of your ranch, a mark was
set on you that reserved you for me. Were it not
for that, you could never have waited for me during
the long years since we traveled together on the <i>Panama</i>.
Why, Meg, there is no woman to compare with
you in all this great city! But, look here! Confound
my impudence! Man-like, I blandly ignore my own defects.
How about my limp?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Derry, in my eyes, there is no man in all the world
to compare with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then we are profoundly satisfied with one another,
and I really don&rsquo;t see what we have to bother
about otherwise. I am going now to tell your father
that we have arranged to be married as soon as I
arrive in England, which will be not more than two
months from this day. I think he likes me, and will
endure me as a son-in-law. If I obeyed my own impulses,
I should not leave you again. I suppose that
common sense urges me to visit New York and Colorado,
just to look into my business affairs. In fact,
in view of our marriage, I simply must go there. But
I shall hurry, never fear. Come along, Meg. I&rsquo;m
wide awake now. You have exorcised the evil spirit
that possessed me; but I shall be in a new fever till<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
next we meet, and there is no more parting in this
life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus was love reborn in Power&rsquo;s heart. The pity
of it was that he did not yield to the tiny god&rsquo;s ardent
whispers, and refuse to relinquish his chosen bride, even
for a brief space. But, as he said, common sense demanded
his presence in America, and common sense has
shattered many dreams.</p>

<h2><small>CHAPTER XVI</small><br />

POWER DRIVEN INTO
WILDERNESS</h2>


<p>Power arrived at New York in mid-winter. He
found that crowded hive humming, as usual, with life
and its activities, but in a new and perplexing way.
The Waldorf Hotel had become the Waldorf-Astoria,
and, while doubling its name, had increased fourfold in
size. Its main corridor had the bustle and crush of a
busy street; but every face had an aspect of aloofness,
almost of hostility. The old, intimate life of America
had vanished. None paid heed to the newcomer. The
spick-and-span occupants of the reception bureau evidently
regarded him as Room Number So-and-so. Confused
and mystified by the well-dressed throng of the
hotel&rsquo;s patrons, he failed to notice, at first, that it
was composed of individuals, or groups, as unknown to
one another as he was to the mass; that, in very truth,
it was</p>

<p class="poem">
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">&ldquo;... no other than a moving row</span><br />
Of Magic Shadow-shapes that come and go.&rdquo;<br />
</p>

<p>He reached the hotel early in the evening, and was
fortunate in being able to secure a suite of rooms.
Soon wearying of the traffic in that world&rsquo;s fair which
caustic New York has nicknamed &ldquo;Rubberneck Alley,&rdquo;
he bought a newspaper, and retired to his apart<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>ments.
But the day&rsquo;s record held no interest for him.
He knew little of the men and women who figured
therein; even less of the events which called for big
type and immense headlines.</p>

<p>But his eye was caught by an announcement of a
performance that night of Gounod&rsquo;s &ldquo;Faust&rdquo; at the
Metropolitan Opera House. He resolved to go there,
never dreaming that the odds were hundreds to one
against the chance of obtaining a seat; for New York
had just entered the lists against the other capitals of
the world, and was determined to capture the leading
place in the grand-opera tourney.</p>

<p>He telephoned the office, &ldquo;Kindly get me a stall for
the Metropolitan this evening.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And, behold! a blas&eacute; clerk was actually stirred out
of boredom by the surprising statement received from
the box-office that a stall had just been returned, and
he could have it now if he closed at once. So Power
never knew what a trick Fortune had played him, since
there can be little doubt that the impression made by
the marvelous music and extraordinarily human appeal
of &ldquo;Faust&rdquo; insensibly prepared him for the tragic
events of the coming day. Imagine a man of musical
bent, who had dwelt seven years among veritable savages,
renewing his acquaintance with the muses by hearing
the most poignant of stage love-stories told in
Gounod&rsquo;s impassioned strains and interpreted by famous
singers and a superb orchestra!</p>

<p>The exquisite tenderness of the doomed lover&rsquo;s first
address to Marguerite thrilled his inmost being.</p>

<p class="poem">
&ldquo;Ne permettrez-vous pas, ma belle demoiselle,<br />
Qu&rsquo;en vous offre le bras, pour faire le chemin?&rdquo;<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span></p>

<p>He was struck by the coincidence that the woman
to whom he was pledged should be named Marguerite!
<i>Faire le chemin!</i> Yes, they would soon be taking the
long road of life together. What assured happiness
seemed to breathe from each perfect note; yet what
horror and despair would be the outcome of the man&rsquo;s
ardor and the maid&rsquo;s shy diffidence! When Marguerite
told Faust that she was <i>ni demoiselle</i>, <i>ni belle</i>, Power
could hardly fail to recollect that his own Marguerite,
not without cruel cause, was ever tortured by the fear
that her disfigurement might some day turn him from
her with loathing. Even the slaying of Valentine as
the direct outcome of his sister&rsquo;s frailty seemed, to
the overwrought imagination of one member of the
audience, to bear an uncanny analogy to his mother&rsquo;s
death. There remained one other point of contact
between the story of the opera and Power&rsquo;s own life;
but, fortunately for him, or his surcharged emotions
might not have withstood the strain, he could not
recognize as yet that last and most terrible similarity.</p>

<p>As it was, his rapt interest in the opera attracted
the attention of his neighbors in the stalls. As a girl
whispered to her attendant cavalier:</p>

<p>&ldquo;That man near us&mdash;the man with the piercing eyes
and worn face&mdash;seems to regard &lsquo;Faust&rsquo; as history
rather than allegory.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps he sees the allegory,&rdquo; was the answer, and
the girl shrugged her pretty shoulders. She was young,
and dwelt in a sheltered garden. To her, &ldquo;Faust&rdquo;
was only an opera. It had nothing to do with the
realities of life; which, if she were asked for a defini<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>tion,
consisted mainly of so ordering one&rsquo;s time as to
miss no important social function.</p>

<p>Next morning, though aware of a nervous system still
in a curious state of exaltation and strain after his
overnight experiences, Power yielded quickly to the
stimulating effect of the keen, cold air and bright sunshine
of a typical winter&rsquo;s day on the North Atlantic
seaboard. After breakfast he walked to his bank, and
was received as one risen from the dead. Financial
institutions, even the soundest and most conservative,
have a special flair for clients who allow vast sums
of money to accumulate, year by year, at rates of
interest which suit the bank&rsquo;s own purposes.</p>

<p>When Power had been welcomed heartily by the
manager&mdash;his friend of former days, now promoted&mdash;the
latter said cheerfully:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, since you have actually returned from Mars,
or whatever planet you may have been visiting, I suppose
you want to look into your account?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It seems a reasonable thing to do, especially as
I am thinking of marrying,&rdquo; agreed Power.</p>

<p>The official gave some instruction to the general office,
and a passbook was produced. There were, of
course, hardly any entries on the debit side, and payments
from mine and ranch had been made half-yearly;
so one small book contained the whole of the seven
years&rsquo; statement. Power, unaccustomed as yet to the
methods of financial bookkeeping, turned to the latest
column, and saw a row of figures. He looked perplexed,
whereat the manager smiled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; came the question, &ldquo;I fancy you find yourself
well able to maintain a wife?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Power&rsquo;s eyes seemed to be fascinated by the item which
had first attracted them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Y-yes,&rdquo; he said hesitatingly; &ldquo;but I had a notion
that I was very much better off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then it was the manager&rsquo;s turn to be puzzled. He
rose, came round the table at which the two were seated,
and adjusted his eyeglasses.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Better off!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Why, you are a very
rich man, Mr. Power. Don&rsquo;t you see&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; He broke
into a loud laugh as he discovered the entry which
this queer-mannered client was gazing at. &ldquo;Man
alive,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;that is the last half-year&rsquo;s interest
on your capital! The current rate is rather low, two
and one-half per cent. Here,&rdquo; and he pointed to the
top of the page, &ldquo;is a summary of your deposit&mdash;four
million dollars, all in hard cash. If you mean to
begin investing, I must ask you to go slow. Even in
your own interests, that is advisable. Heavy purchases
of stock tend to bull the market, and it is a
little inclined to go that way at the moment. I&rsquo;ll give
you a list of gilt-edged securities which will, of course,
nearly double your annual revenue from invested capital
alone. You had better show it to some other adviser,
and, when you have selected your stocks, let me
begin operating. I can carry the whole thing through
in a couple of months without letting Wall Street know
that a big buyer is in the market.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Power was rather stunned by the amount of his
wealth, and an odd thought darted through his brain
that if, in the world of today, no tempter could bribe
another Doctor Faustus with the offer of renewed
youth, the fiend might pour gold into his chosen vic<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>tim&rsquo;s
pockets. Almost could he feel the mocking phantom
at his shoulder; though, indeed, there was none
other in the room than the courteous banker.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Great Scott!&rdquo; the latter was saying. &ldquo;What a
bonanza that mine of yours is! And Bison is growing
quite a town. I paid it a flying visit last summer.
Have you been there recently? I imagine not, since
your cablegram came from Buenos Aires.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bison was a word to evoke shadows; but it sufficed
to drive one away just then.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, Bison!&rdquo; said Power, standing up. &ldquo;I must go
west at once. I have not even made known to MacGonigal
my presence in America. He is well, I
hope?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fatter than ever. There is some talk of his running
for governor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And Jake, the man in charge of the ranch? Did
you hear of him when you were in Colorado?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed. He is married.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Married! Jake!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;More than that, his wife, a pretty little woman,
told me she had to threaten a divorce in order to stop
him from mounting the little Jakes on what he calls
&lsquo;plugs&rsquo; before the kiddies were well out of the perambulator.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A clerk announced through a speaking-tube that
someone wanted the banker. The conventional, &ldquo;Ask
him to wait one minute,&rdquo; warned Power that this was
no hour for gossip.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can have some money now?&rdquo; he inquired.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As much as you like.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;May I ask&mdash;I am a child in these matters&mdash;if good<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
diamonds are obtainable in New York, and what I ought
to pay for a ring&mdash;an engagement ring?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our diamonds are not cheap; but they are supposed
to be the pick of the market. I think you ought
to get a perfect ring for a thousand dollars. By the
way, there is quite an accumulation of letters here.
Leave your address, and they will be packed and sent
to your rooms.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Power wrote a check at the counter, and was given
a bundle of notes. He went to a well-known jewelry
establishment recommended by the bank manager, and
asked to be shown some engagement rings.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What size, sir?&rdquo; inquired an attendant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, not anything remarkable, but of the best quality.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I mean, sir, what size is the lady&rsquo;s finger?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Power laughed. He realized that he must come down
out of the clouds, and pay heed occasionally to the
minor phases of life.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. She has small hands, and, long,
tapering fingers,&rdquo; he said, smiling at his own fatuity;
for the description might have been a line taken bodily
out of nineteen novels among every twenty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It really doesn&rsquo;t matter, sir,&rdquo; said the shopman,
eager to please a new customer. &ldquo;If you choose a
suitable ring, the lady can send or bring it here, and
it will be adjusted to the right size without any delay
or extra charge.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But she is in England.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Exactly the same conditions apply in our London
branch.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Power bought a very beautiful ring, which hap<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>pened
to contain seven graduated stones in a single
row. The number pleased him, and he was sure Meg
would note its significance. He secured the gage thus
early so that he might write and tell her about it; while
its mere possession and safeguarding would supply an
extra stimulus for a speedy crossing of the Atlantic.</p>

<p>Then he strolled up Fifth Avenue, and did not flinch
from memories of the last time he had passed through
that remarkable thoroughfare. He would be callous,
indeed, if his thoughts did not dwell on Nancy, and go
back to the sweet lawlessness of their brief companionship.
Where was she now? he wondered. A fine
lady, no doubt, ruffling it with matronly self-possession
among the high-born friends she had won
in Paris and London. And that mean-spirited wretch,
her father? Dead, in all probability, or eating his
heart out in semi-insanity; for Power was beginning
to see, with surer, wider vision, that Willard must have
known he was a murderer, since no other hand but
his had sent a dear and honored woman to her grave.</p>

<p>Then his mind reverted to Marguerite Sinclair, and
he was comforted by his knowledge of her frank, joyous,
make-the-best-of-everything temperament. He had
not deluded himself into the belief that he was marrying
her in the flood-tide of passion which had overwhelmed
Nancy and himself. Pretense was always hateful
to him, and it would be rank hypocrisy to assume
that the madness of that first love could ever again
surge through heart and brain. Marguerite&rsquo;s own
action in accepting him after she had looked into the
pages of his earlier life gave ample assurance that
she would be content with his faith and devotion. She<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
was no lovesick maid, but a woman of strong, clear
perceptions. He was troubled with no doubt as to
the future nor qualm as to the past, and he thanked
Providence humbly for having allotted him such a true
and honest helpmate for his remaining years.</p>

<p>On returning to the hotel, he found a bulky package
in his room. It contained heaps of letters and
other documents which had been sent to the bank
or forwarded from Bison, and, of course, they were
mostly seven years old, or thereabouts. Two, bearing
recent postmarks, caught his eye, and he read them
first.</p>

<p>One was from Dacre. &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; it ran, &ldquo;I remain
on the map. If this reaches you, cable me. My house
is yours for as long as you care to stay.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The other brought a smile to his lips. It was in
Spanish, and signed &ldquo;Bartolomeo Malaspina&rdquo;:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;Honored Se&ntilde;or [wrote the captain of the <i>Carmen</i>].&mdash;&ldquo;You
asked me to write after seven years. Well, praised
be my patron saint, I am still alive, and I hope you are.
I have often spoken to my wife of the wretchedness of
soul you caused me by disappearing among those accursed
Indians; but I must admit, nevertheless, that your short
voyage in my ship brought me luck, for I fell in with a
liner with a broken shaft caused by colliding with a derelict,
and she was drifting into the reefs off Hanover Island
when I got a tow-rope on board. It was a fine job to haul
her as far as Punta Arenas; but, thanks to the Eleven Thousand
Virgins, I managed it, and the salvage made me a
rich man. The <i>Carmen</i>, too, ran ashore at Iquique on the
homeward voyage, and she was well insured. Write, I pray
you, if you have escaped from the cannibals. If not, a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
year from this date, I shall pay for two masses for the
repose of your soul.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>So, then, he was remembered by a few friends. The
knowledge consoled him for the heedless rush and flurry
of New York.</p>

<p>An impulse seized him to break the seals of an envelop
marked, &ldquo;To be burnt, unopened, by my executors,&rdquo;
and take therefrom two letters which he knew
it contained. The action was nothing more nor less
than a trial of his new-born resolve; since the letters
were Nancy&rsquo;s to himself and Willard&rsquo;s to his mother.
He read them calmly and dispassionately. Willard&rsquo;s
malicious threat he dismissed quickly. It had served
its vile purpose, and its victims had paid the price demanded,
the mother by death, the son by suffering. But
Nancy&rsquo;s few disconnected sentences gripped his imagination
with a new force. Had he misjudged her? he
wondered. What argument had Willard used that she
yielded so promptly and completely? The broken, pitiful
words brought a mist before his eyes. Poor girl!
Perhaps, in her woman&rsquo;s way, she had endured miseries
from which life among the Indians had rescued him.
Then he recalled the farewell message she had given
to Dacre, and the momentary belief that he might have
acted precipitately died away. Should he ever meet
her in the years to come? He hoped not, with all his
heart. He must so contrive Meg&rsquo;s life and his own
that they would pass their days far from the haunts of
society. The worship of the golden calf permits its
votaries no escape. Thank Heaven, and he and his
wife would never practise the cult!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span></p>

<p>Glancing casually through the rest of the heap, his
attention was drawn to a couple of cablegrams. He
opened one, and found that it was dated in the late
autumn of that memorable year. It read:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;Leave everything, and forget all that has passed. Come
at once.</p>

<p class="ralign">
&ldquo;N.&rdquo;<br />
</p></div>

<p>One night, sleeping in the depths of a Patagonian
forest, he had been aroused by the snarl of some wild
animal close at hand. He had never known what beast
it was that rustled away among the undergrowth; but
he felt the same sense of impending evil now. Thinking
the other message might be more explanatory, he
tore at the envelop with nervous fingers; but the contents
were an exact replica of its predecessor. Then
he saw that one had been sent to Bison and the other
to New York on the same day, the place of origin of
each being London.</p>

<p>He could not doubt that &ldquo;N&rdquo; was &ldquo;Nancy,&rdquo; and he
asked himself, with quick foreboding, what strong motive
had inspired this urgent command. He was to
forget all that had passed! What strangely variable
creatures woman were, to be sure! Could she,
or any woman, honestly imagine that such a request
might be obeyed? Forget that struggle between love
and duty; forget the delirium of that fortnight in the
Adirondacks; forget the numb agony of the days following
her flight? As soon might a man forget his
own name!</p>

<p>Nerving himself to the task, he searched for some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
written word which should make clear the baffling
enigma. Soon he came across two letters in Nancy&rsquo;s
handwriting, and bearing the London postmark. The
dates were three months apart, and the earlier one
corresponded with that on the cablegrams; so he opened
it first, and read:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;My own dear Derry.&mdash;A few hours ago I cabled you,
both to Bison and New York, that you are to come to me
without delay, and I hope, I even pray on my knees, that
you are already in the train or steamer. Still, I am in such
a fever of dread lest any untoward event may have kept my
message from you, or prevented you from starting instantly,
that I write also. If, which Heaven forbid, any shred
of doubt or misgiving has gripped you, and you have decided
to await a more explicit reason for my action in
bidding you come, I am writing by to-day&rsquo;s mail to tell
you that circumstances beyond my control, or yours, render
it imperative that I should leave Hugh Marten now and
forever. Derry, don&rsquo;t ask me to explain myself more fully.
There are things which a woman may whisper, but which
she cannot write. Yet it is only just that I should, at
least, make plain the dreadful conditions under which I
left you five months since. My father meant to kill you
before my eyes. No consideration would have stopped him.
He was resolved to shoot you without warning if I refused
to return to Marten&rsquo;s house, and I yielded; for I could
not bear the thought of seeing you stretched lifeless in
front of the dear little hut in which we had been so happy.
I may have been weak, but I loved you too much to let
you give your life in exchange for my love, and he convinced
me that he was in deadly earnest. So I went away
with him, and tried to make myself despicable in your
eyes as the surest way of searing the bitter wound my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
action would cause. Remember, he left me no alternative.
The break had to be final, or he would seek you out and
slay you without mercy, and I knew only too well that
he not only meant what he said, but that our laws would
support and public opinion acclaim his action. Well, I
traveled with him to England, and have been so ill ever
since&mdash;though not physically such a wreck as I have pretended
to be&mdash;that Marten believes I am suffering from the
effects of the heat wave, and has compelled me to endure
the treatment and scrutiny of many doctors. And today,
one of them&mdash;&mdash; But now I must be dumb, except to tell
you that, whether or not it means death to both of us,
you <i>must</i> come and take me away to some secret place where
none can find us. Don&rsquo;t think that this letter is written
in a moment of impulse. It is not the product of a woman&rsquo;s
hysteria. It is a cry from my very heart. And, in the
midst of my desolation, I am glad&mdash;oh, so glad! I am
aflame with a delight that is almost superhuman; for I
know that you will understand, and that nothing on earth
can ever part us again. My tears are falling on this page,
but my higher and truer self is singing a canticle of praise
and wonderful joy. Hurry, Derry, hurry!</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am, and have ever been,</p>

<p class="ralign">
<span style="margin-right: 2em;">&ldquo;Your true and devoted</span><br />
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Nancy</span>.&rdquo;<br />
</p></div>

<p>Power&rsquo;s brain was on fire as he read; but his heart
seemed to be in the clutch of an icy hand. For some
minutes&mdash;he never subsequently knew how long the
trance lasted&mdash;he was transported bodily to the shores
of a sunlit lake, and he lived again through the frenzy
of those first hours after Nancy&rsquo;s disappearance.
When his senses came back, and his blazing eyes could
discern the written word, he read and reread those<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
parts of the letter which breathed her secret. Then,
with the listless despair of a man who realizes that the
new sanctuary of hope and self-confidence which he
had constructed with so much blind faith, to which he
had given so many laborious years, was tumbling in
ruins at his feet, he opened the second letter, which
was somewhat bulky, and crackled under his touch.
From the middle of the folded sheet he took a withered
spray of white heather. Had it been a poisonous
snake he could not have started more violently. There
was no doubting either its origin or significance. He
held in his shaking hands the very spray Nancy carried
at her wedding, and she had sent it as a token
that all was at an end between them. He was minded
then and there to commit the whole pile of correspondence
to destroying flames; but he was well aware that
such a coward&rsquo;s trick would prove of no avail. Strive
as he might, he could never expel from his breast the
blighting knowledge lodged there now and forever.
Those shrunken and faded strands of heather were
typical of his own life. Not all the alchemies of wizardry
or miracles of science could restore their bright
hues. They were dead, and sinking slowly into dust.
No shower from Heaven could freshen them, no kindly
care quicken them into vitality. They were dead, and
he was dead, a mere dried-up husk of a man, a banned
creature, to whom hope and faith and the bright vision
of a new career were ruthlessly forbidden.</p>

<p>At last, thinking he might as well learn the scorching
truth in its entirety, he turned to the letter.</p>

<p>It was undated; but the postmark was eloquent, and
it began with strange abruptness:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;So, then, Derry, you have cast me off, left me to die;
for I shall die within a month, or less. Well, be it so.
I am content. If such is the woman&rsquo;s lot, of what avail
to cry aloud to Heaven that it is unjust? But, if ever
you come to realize what tortures I have endured while
waiting in vain for the answer that never arrived, surely
you will pity me. I, once so full of the joy of life, am
humbled to the dust. Your departure from Bison&mdash;for my
constant friend MacGonigal has told me of your going&mdash;robbed
me of my last frail refuge. Some day, perhaps, you
will read these farewell words of the woman who loved
you, who still loves you, who will love you to the end, whose
last prayer will be for you and not for herself. Oh, Derry,
it will be hard to pass into the everlasting night, knowing
that you and I shall never meet again on this side of the
grave, but harder still to deliver into the keeping of one
whom I loathe the living memory of my brief happiness.
It may not be so. My child and I may go out into the
darkness together; but I dare not petition the Most High
for that crowning mercy. Have I really done wrong? I
cannot decide, but grope blindly for guidance. If I am
judged, it will be by One who looks into the heart, and
will treat an erring woman with divine compassion as well
as justice. But you, if ever you see what I am setting
down here, and I am convinced that you will, even though
I be long dead&mdash;what of you? My heart aches for you.
Can I give you any message of healing and solace? Yes,
one. If my child lives&mdash;ah, it is bitter to think that the
mother&rsquo;s eyes will be glazing in death when they see her
babe!&mdash;I charge you with a sacred responsibility. What do
I mean? I cannot tell you. I am fey today. I peer into
a dim future. I only know that I shall not survive my
little one&rsquo;s birth, and that some day, somehow, you will
understand that which is hidden from my ken in laying<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
this duty upon you. And that way will come consolation.
Do you remember how I used to hate that word &lsquo;duty&rsquo;?
Yet it is stronger than I. It compels me, even now.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Farewell, Derry. I kiss you, in a waking dream. No
matter what the world has in store for you&mdash;though some
other fair woman may quicken into life because of you&mdash;though
men may honor your name and exalt you to the
high places&mdash;you will never forget the girl you once held
dear. As a souvenir, I send you all that is left of the
bunch of white heather which formed my wedding bouquet.
Did you see it that day when you hid on the ledge, and
watched the triumphal start of a journey which has led
me into such strange places and is now to end so soon?
We never spoke of it when we passed the long, sunny hours
by the lake&mdash;dear Heaven! our lake! Would that its bright
waters had closed over my head then; for I was so happy,
and so much in love with you and the world! But I knew
what happened on that June day in the Gulch, for I could
read your soul mirrored in your eyes; so now I give you
one final memento, and hug the belief that you will press it
to your lips. My poor secret dies with me, perhaps. I
don&rsquo;t imagine that the man whom I used to revere as a
father will satisfy an unfathomable spite by denying my
child the tending and luxury it will receive in Hugh Marten&rsquo;s
care. I could write reams of a woman&rsquo;s sad longings,
of explanations that would lead nowhere; but I dare not
trust even you, else you would deem me mad. And I am
not mad, only woebegone and fearful, for the night cometh,
and I shudder at its silence and mystery. So, once more,
and for the last time, farewell, my dear. I take you in
my arms. I cling to you, even in death.&rdquo;</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The unhappy man wilted under that piteous leave-taking.
He felt that he had descended into a tomb,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
and was listening to a voice speaking in dread tones.
The thick curtains of despair closed over his soul, and
he seemed to be falling into an abyss. He heard himself
uttering a broken wail of protest; for it was borne
in on him that Nancy&rsquo;s heart-rending message had riveted
close against the fetters he thought to have left
forever amid the dun recesses of the Andes. What remained
in life for him? What could there be of
happiness and content, with the dire conviction lodged
immovably in heart and brain that Nancy, like his
mother, had died because of his wrong-doing? He was
caught in some furious and fatal maelstrom which, like
that fabled whirlpool of the North Sea, was sweeping
him, in ever-narrowing circles, to irresistible doom.
The marvel is that his mind did not give way; but a
merciful release was not to be vouchsafed in that manner,
for the fantastic laughter of lunacy would have
been kinder than the blackness of darkness which now
enwrapped his being. In that hour of abasement his
spirit capitulated. Nothing mattered. He was crushed
and paralyzed. He could not pray, because it did not
seem as though there was One who gave heed. The
bright world had become a place of skulls, a charnel
house, a prison whose iron walls were closing in on
him eternally.</p>

<p>It was a strange thing that he did not, even as a
passing obsession, think of terminating the dreary pilgrimage
of life then and there. At Bison, during the
first stupor of grief after his mother&rsquo;s death and
Nancy&rsquo;s desertion, he had pondered, many a time, the
awful problem which ever presents itself to men of
strong will and resolute purpose. When life appears<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
to be no longer worth living the question arises&mdash;why
not end it? But seven years of lonely musing had
given depth and solidity to his nature. Above all, he
had been taught to endure. He had come now to a
worse pass than any that pierced the Andes; for an
unending desert lay in front, while he was leaving a
fair territory in which lay domestic joys and a love
for which his soul hungered. In the moment when
union with Marguerite Sinclair was forbidden so
sternly he gaged with woeful accuracy the extent of
his longing for her companionship. He understood,
with a certainty of judgment that brooked no counter
argument, that he could never marry. He dared not.
If that which Nancy had said was true, he would surely
kill himself in a paroxysm of loathing and self-accusation
when any other woman&rsquo;s kiss was still hot on his lips.</p>

<p>There remained a task not to be shirked&mdash;he must
ascertain, beyond doubt, that Nancy was really dead.
Gathering the four letters in whose yellowing sheets
was summarized the whole story of his wasted life, he
placed them in a pocketbook. In doing so, he happened
to touch the case containing the ring he had
bought for Meg. Oddly enough, that simple incident
cost him the sharpest pang; but he conquered his emotions,
much as a man might do who was facing unavoidable
death, and even forced his trembling fingers
to put the envelop which held Nancy&rsquo;s white heather
side by side with Marguerite&rsquo;s diamonds. Then he
went out.</p>

<p>An oldtime acquaintance in Denver with the ways
of journalism led him to the nearest newspaper office.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
There he asked to be taken to the news editor&rsquo;s room,
and a busy man looked at him curiously when he explained
that he wanted to know whether or not Mrs.
Marten, wife of Hugh Marten, was living, and, if dead,
the date of her demise.</p>

<p>There was something in Power&rsquo;s manner that puzzled
the journalist, some hint of tragedy and immeasurable
loss, but he was courteously explicit.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean Hugh Marten, the financier, formerly
of Colorado?&rdquo; he inquired.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, that is the man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The other took a volume from a shelf of biographies,
by which is meant the newspaper variety&mdash;typed
accounts of notable people still living, together
with newspaper cuttings referring to recent events
in their careers. Soon he had a pencil on an
entry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Mrs. Marten has been dead
nearly seven years.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And her child? Is the child living?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. Poor lady! She died in giving it birth. I
remember now. It was a very sad business. Mrs.
Marten was a remarkably beautiful woman. Her husband
was inconsolable. He has not married again; but
is devoted to his little daughter, who, by the way,
was named after her mother&mdash;Nancy Willard Marten.
Ah, of course, that middle name reminds me
of something else. Mrs. Marten&rsquo;s father, Francis Willard,
was accidentally shot last year.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shot?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. He was summering in the Adirondacks, and
was out after duck; but, by some mischance, caught<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
a trigger when crawling through a clump of rushes,
and blew the top of his head off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was near a lake, then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. It wasn&rsquo;t Forked Lake, but a sheet of water
in the hills not far distant. I can find out the
exact locality if you wish it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, thank you. I am very much obliged to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No trouble at all. Sorry I hadn&rsquo;t better news,
if these people are friends of yours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Willard was dead, and by his own hand, and the
scene of his last reckoning was the lake which witnessed
the ignoble revenge he had wreaked on Power
by sacrificing Nancy! The broken man bowed his
head humbly. He had been scourged with whips; but
his sworn enemy had been chastised with scorpions.</p>

<h2><small>CHAPTER XVII</small><br />

SHOWING HOW POWER MET A
GUIDE</h2>


<p>If a man be harassed too greatly by outrageous
fortune, there comes a time when he will defy the
oppressing gods, and set their edicts at naught.
Power&rsquo;s temperament fitted him for sacrifice carried
far beyond the common limits of human endurance;
but his gorge rose against this latest tyranny; the
recoil from bright hope to darkest despair brought
him perilously near the gulf. Seated in his room, and
reviewing his wrecked life, he was minded then and
there to fling himself into the worst dissipation New
York could offer. What had he gained by his self-imposed
penance, his exile, and his unquestioning service?
No monk of La Trappe had disciplined body
and soul more rigorously than he during seven weary
years; yet, seemingly, his atonement was not accepted,
and he was faced now by a decree that entailed unending
banishment. Was Providence, then, less merciful
than man? The felon, convicted of an offense
against his country&rsquo;s laws, was better treated than
he. The poor wretch released from prison was met
at the gates of the penitentiary by philanthropic offer
of reinstatement among his fellows; but for the
man who had yielded once to the lure of a woman&rsquo;s
love there was, apparently, no forgiveness. Why<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
should he accept any such inexorable ban? He was
young, as men regard youth in these days. He was
rich. The wine of life ran red in his veins. Why
should he fold his arms and bend his head, and say
with the meek Jesuit whose moldering bones had harbored
that beautiful volume lying there in its leather
covering, &ldquo;<i>Fiat voluntas Tua!</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>That hour of revolt was the bitterest in Power&rsquo;s
existence. Like Jacob, he wrestled with a too potent
adversary, and, refusing to yield, asked for a curse
rather than a blessing; for he thought he was striving
against a fiend. Fortunately, he underestimated his
own strength. Some men, he knew, would have tossed
every record of the past into the fire, and married
the woman of their choice without other than a momentary
qualm of conscience. That course, to him,
was a sheer impossibility. While the dead Nancy and
her living child stood in the gates of Eden, and option
lay only between wedding Marguerite Sinclair and
blowing out his brains, he would die unhesitatingly.
But, if he continued to live, what was the outlook?
Wine, women&mdash;debauchery, lewdness? His soul sickened
at the notion. He laughed, with bitter humor,
while picturing himself a rou&eacute;, a &ldquo;sport&rdquo;, an opulent
supporter of musical comedy&mdash;especially with regard
to its frailer exponents&mdash;a lounger in &ldquo;fashionable&rdquo;
resorts. No; that was not the way out of the maze,
if ever a way might be found.</p>

<p>It was a sign of returning sanity that he should fill
his pipe. As the German proverb has it, &ldquo;God first
made man, and then He made woman; then, feeling
sorry for man, He made tobacco&rdquo;. Power continued<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
to sit there smoking, lost in troubled but more humbled
thought, until a chambermaid entered the room.
He had kept no count of time, and had evidently
passed many hours in somber musing; for the apartment
was in semidarkness, and the girl started when
she caught sight of the solitary figure sunk in the
depths of an armchair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My land!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;but you made me jump!&rdquo;
Then, aware that this was not precisely the manner
of address expected by patrons of the Waldorf-Astoria,
she added hurriedly, &ldquo;I beg your pardon, sir. I
didn&rsquo;t know you were in. Shall I switch on the light?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can you?&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, of course, I can. There you are!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The room was suddenly illuminated. Power rose and
stretched his limbs&mdash;he felt as if he had marched many
miles carrying a heavy load.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Like others of your sex, you work miracles, then,&rdquo;
he said.</p>

<p>One glance at his face, and the housemaid regained
confidence. &ldquo;Yes, if it is a miracle to touch a switch,&rdquo;
she answered pertly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing more wonderful was done when the world
was created. &lsquo;Let there be light: and there was light.&rsquo;
You have read the first chapter of Genesis, I am sure?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and the second.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good! Stop there, if you would rest thoroughly
content. The serpent lifts his head in the third. Will
you kindly send the valet?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girl confided to her fellow-servants in the
service-room that the gentleman in Number So-and-so
was very nice, but slightly cracked. He seemed to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
have been upset by a lot of old letters&mdash;and it was
an odd thing that among all the rich people who
lived in the hotel none seemed to be really happy. Now,
if she, deponent, only possessed a fraction of their
wealth, she would enjoy life to the limit.</p>

<p>Power did not change his attire that evening. He
dined quietly in the restaurant, and strolled out into
Broadway afterward. The loneliness of a great city,
at first so repellent, was grateful to him now. The
crowded streets were more democratic than the palatial
saloons of the hotel, the air more breathable. But
the flood of light in the Great White Way&mdash;though
blazing then with a subdued magnificence as
compared with its bewildering luster nowadays&mdash;was
garish and harsh, and he turned into the sheltering
gloom of a quiet side-street. He was passing a row
of red-stone houses&mdash;bay-windowed, austere abodes,
with porches surmounting steep flights of broad steps&mdash;when
he saw an old, old man seated at the foot of
one of these outer stairways. In summer, at that hour,
every step would be occupied by people gasping for
fresh, cool air; but in the depth of winter it was courting
disease and death for anyone, especially the aged,
to seek such repose.</p>

<p>The unusual spectacle stirred Power out of his
mournful self-communing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you ill?&rdquo; he said, halting in front of the
patriarch.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sorr,&rdquo; came the cheerful answer, and a worn,
deeply lined face was raised to his with a smile that
banished the ravages of time as sunlight gilds a ruin.
A street-lamp was near, and its rays fell on features<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
which had once been strong and massive, but were now
mellowed into the rare beauty of hale and kindly age.
Silvery hair, still plentiful, and dark, keen eyes from
which gleamed the intelligence and sympathy every
clean-souled man may hope to gain if his years stretch
beyond the span allotted by the prophet, made up a
personality which would have appealed to an artist
in search of a model.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you are taking a great risk by sitting on cold
stone,&rdquo; persisted Power.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure, sorr, av it&rsquo;s the will o&rsquo; God that I should
die that way, it&rsquo;s as good as anny other,&rdquo; said the
ancient. &ldquo;All doores ladin&rsquo; to the next worruld are
pretty much the same to me. I don&rsquo;t care which
wan I take so long as it lades me safe into Purgathory.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Never before had Power heard so modest a claim
on the benevolence of the Almighty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you tired of life, then?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sorra a bit am I! Why should I be? Wouldn&rsquo;t
it be flyin&rsquo; in the face o&rsquo; Providence to say that I was
tired of the sivinty-eight grand years I&rsquo;ve spint in
raisonable happiness an&rsquo; the best o&rsquo; health.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I like your philosophy. It has the right ring.
But it can hardly be the will of God that you should
shorten the remainder of those years by resting on
a doorstep in this weather.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Young man,&rdquo; said the other suddenly, &ldquo;how old
are ye?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thirty-five.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thorty-foive is it? An&rsquo; ye stand there an&rsquo; talk
as though ye&rsquo;d just come down like Moses from the top
o&rsquo; Mount Sinai, an&rsquo; had the worrd o&rsquo; the Lord nately<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
written in yer pocketbook. Sure, thim days is past
entirely. God doesn&rsquo;t talk to His sarvints anny longer
in that way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell me, then, how does He talk?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Faix, sorr, I&rsquo;m on&rsquo;y a poor ould man, an&rsquo; it&rsquo;s not
for the likes o&rsquo; me to insthruct a gintleman like you;
but, av I&rsquo;m not greatly mistaken, you&rsquo;ve heard His
voice more than wance or twice in yer life already,
an&rsquo; yer own heart&rsquo;ll tell you betther than I can what
it sounds like.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Friend, your eyes are clearer than mine. Still,
it will please me if you get up, and let me walk a
little way with you. Or, if you don&rsquo;t feel able to
walk, allow me to take you to your destination in
a cab.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His new acquaintance rose, nimbly enough. Then
Power saw that he had been using a bundle of newspapers
as a cushion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A cab, is it?&rdquo; laughed the other. &ldquo;My! but
money must come aisy your road, a thing it &rsquo;ud nivver
do for me, thry as I might, an&rsquo; I was a hard
worrker in me time. But I&rsquo;d sooner walk. I&rsquo;m feelin&rsquo;
a thrifle shtiff, an&rsquo; I haven&rsquo;t far to go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;May I come with you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ye may, an&rsquo; welcome. It&rsquo;s a mighty pleasant
thing to have a fri&rsquo;ndly chat wid a man who has sinse
enough to wear fine clo&rsquo;es an&rsquo; talk like the aristocracy,
an&rsquo; yet not be ashamed to be seen sp&rsquo;akin&rsquo; to wan o&rsquo;
my sort.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you think it rude if I inquire what you mean
to do with those newspapers? Surely, at your age,
you don&rsquo;t sell them in the streets.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Faith, I&rsquo;ll have to thry my hand at it now, an&rsquo;
no mistake. Me grandson, Jimmy Maguire, was run
over this afthernoon by an express van, an&rsquo; he&rsquo;s up
there at the hospital in West 16th Street. Jimmy is
all that is left betune me an&rsquo; the wall, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo;
now to give in his returns. Mebbe the newspaper folk
will let me hould his stand till the docthors sind him
out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And if they don&rsquo;t?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure, sorr, God is good to the poor Irish.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope so, most sincerely. Still, a newspaper is
a commercial enterprise, and the publisher may think
you unequal to the job. What then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thin? I&rsquo;d take a reef in me belt for breakfast,
an&rsquo; spind a p&rsquo;aceful hour in the cathaydral, that
dhrame in shtone up there on Fifth Avenue. Don&rsquo;t
ye remimber that verse in the Psalms, &lsquo;I have been
young, and now am old; yet have I not seen the righteous
forsaken nor his seed begging bread.&rsquo; Manny&rsquo;s
the toime thim worrds have consoled me whin iverything
looked black, an&rsquo; I was throubled wid quare
thoughts, bein&rsquo; nigh famishin&rsquo; wid hunger.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you actually wanted food&mdash;here, in this
great city?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The old fellow laughed merrily. Evidently, he found
the question humorous.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure, I&rsquo;ve had the misforchunes of Job,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;First, I lost me darlin&rsquo; wife. Thin I lost me job
as a buildher&rsquo;s foreman. I had two sons, and wan was
dhrowned at say, an&rsquo; the other was killed in a
mine&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In a mine? What sort of mine?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A gold mine, at a place called Bison, in Colorado.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nine years ago last Christmas?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was his name Maguire?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sorr&mdash;Rafferty. A foine, upshtandin&rsquo; boy he
was, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Power recalled the incident. Indeed, he had helped
to clear the rockfall which crushed the life out of
the unfortunate miner. But he gave no sign of his
knowledge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why is your grandson named Maguire?&rdquo; he
went on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is my daughther&rsquo;s son, an&rsquo; she died in childbirth.
More&rsquo;s the pity, because Maguire was a dacint
man; but he took to the dhrink afther she was gone,
an&rsquo; that was the ind of him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yet you are a firm believer in the goodness of
Providence, notwithstanding all these cruel blows?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Musha, sorr,&rdquo; said Rafferty anxiously, &ldquo;have ye
nivver read the Book o&rsquo; Job? Look at the thrials an&rsquo;
crosses put on that poor ould craythur, an&rsquo; where
would he have been if the thrue faith wasn&rsquo;t in him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rafferty, I would give ten years of my life to
believe as you believe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indade, sorr, ye needn&rsquo;t give tin minutes. Go home
to yer room, an&rsquo; sink down on your marrowbones, an&rsquo;
ax for help an&rsquo; guidance, an&rsquo; they&rsquo;ll be given you as
sure as the sun will rise tomorrow. Though, moind
ye, ye mayn&rsquo;t know it all at wance, just as it may be
rainin&rsquo; tomorrow, when the sun will be hid; but he&rsquo;ll
be shinin&rsquo; high up in the sky for all that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The two crossed Sixth Avenue together, and Raf<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>ferty
pointed to a big building, a place ablaze with
light and quivering with the activities of six-decker
printing machines.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s where I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo;,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Maybe they&rsquo;ll
detain me some toime.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Before we part, my friend, tell me where you live.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Away over in the poorest part o&rsquo; Twinty-sivinth
Street, sorr.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And how old is your grandson?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be eleven next birthday.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is he seriously injured?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then tears came into the old man&rsquo;s eyes. For once
his splendid courage wavered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They wouldn&rsquo;t tell me at the hospital, an&rsquo; that&rsquo;s
the truth, sorr; but a polisman who helped to pull
him from undher the wagon said he thought he had
escaped the worrst.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you and Jimmy known to any of the priests
at the cathedral?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure, sorr, don&rsquo;t they all know us? I remimber
Canon M&rsquo;Evoy comin&rsquo; there twinty-foive years ago.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now, Rafferty, as one friend to another, will
you let me help you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Musha, an&rsquo; is it beggin&rsquo; you think I am?&rdquo; and a
gleam of Celtic fire shone through the mist of anguish.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. But you have given me good counsel tonight,
and I am minded to pay for it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Faith, I haven&rsquo;t said a worrd that isn&rsquo;t plain for
all min, an&rsquo; women, too, to read, if they have a moind
to look for it in the right place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sometimes one needs reminding of that, and you
have done it. Come, now. Let me finance you with a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
few dollars, just to carry you along till Jimmy is
around again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rafferty drew a knotted hand across his eyes, and
then peered keenly into Power&rsquo;s face. What he saw
there seemed to reassure him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, an&rsquo; it&rsquo;s me that&rsquo;s the lucky man, an&rsquo; no mistake!&rdquo;
he cried, while whole-hearted joy seemed to make
him young again. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take your help in the spirit
it&rsquo;s offered in, sorr. If the situation was revarsed,
I&rsquo;d do what I could for you, because you have the
look av a man who&rsquo;d do unto others that which he
wants others to do unto him. An&rsquo;, by that same token,
I&rsquo;ve as much chance av gettin&rsquo; Jimmy&rsquo;s stand wid the
papers as I have av bein&rsquo; run for Prisident av the
United States next fall.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Power took a folded note from his pocketbook.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Put that where the cat can&rsquo;t get it,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;And now goodby, and thank you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But something unusual in the aspect of the note
caused Rafferty to open it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure, an&rsquo; you were nearly committin&rsquo; a terrible
blundher!&rdquo; he cried excitedly. &ldquo;This is a hundred
dollars, sorr, an&rsquo; you&rsquo;d be m&rsquo;anin&rsquo;, mebbe, to give me
a foive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. Don&rsquo;t be vexed with me, but that amount of
money will make things easy during the next month
or so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The next month! Glory be to God, I can live like
a prince for three months, on a hundred dollars!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I firmly believe that you will live better than most
princes.... That&rsquo;s right. Stow it away carefully,
and don&rsquo;t forget that I am still your debtor.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, sorr, I can nivver repay you as long as I
live.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, you can. Remember me when you go
to the cathedral tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sorr, may I ax yer name?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Power&mdash;John Darien Power.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Arrah, an&rsquo; are ye Irish?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis an Irish name, annyhow. But it matthers little
what nation ye belong to. You&rsquo;re a rale Christian,
an&rsquo; &rsquo;tis writ in your face.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There have been times when I would have doubted
that; but the spirit of God has been abroad in New
York tonight, and, perhaps, it has descended on me.
Once more, goodby! I needn&rsquo;t wish you content, because
you cinched that long ago.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, sorr, may Hivin bless ye! Manny&rsquo;s the heart
you&rsquo;ll make light in this vale av tears, or I&rsquo;m no judge
av a man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It seemed to Power&rsquo;s overwrought imagination as
though Rafferty had suddenly assumed the guise and
bearing of a supernatural being. Those concluding
words rang in his ears as he hurried away. They had
the sound of a message, an exhortation. The iron
walls which appeared to encircle him had been cast
down. His feet were set on an open road, fair and
inviting, and he cared not whither it led so long as
he escaped from the prison in which his soul might
have been pent eternally.</p>

<p>Diving through a press of traffic, he reached the
opposite side of a small square. A congestion of street-cars
and other vehicles cleared during a brief interval,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
and, looking back, he saw the old man standing motionless,
gazing up at the sky. At that instant a
ragged urchin, carrying a bundle of papers, seemed
to recognize Rafferty, and spoke to him.</p>

<p>The Irishman, called back to earth, bent over the
youth, and, evidently obeying a generous impulse,
added his own store of &ldquo;returns&rdquo; to those of the boy,
patted him on the head, and pointed to a doorway.</p>

<p>Power could have repeated with tolerable accuracy
every word that passed, though the notable din of New
York was quadrupled in that particular locality:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, how&rsquo;s Jimmy, Mr. Rafferty?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eh? Faix, he&rsquo;s mighty bad, but God is good, and
mebbe he&rsquo;ll recover. Is it takin&rsquo; in yer returns ye
are? Well, now, here&rsquo;s some I don&rsquo;t want; so just add
thim to yer own shtock, an&rsquo; mind ye&rsquo;ll be afther takin&rsquo;
the money to yer mother. She needs it more&rsquo;n I do,
the poor sowl.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then the man of faith recrossed Sixth Avenue, and
was lost to sight.</p>

<p>In his room that night Power wrote to Marguerite:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;My dear Meg.&mdash;This is my first and last letter to you;
so I pray you read it with sympathy. Today I bought a
ring at a jeweler&rsquo;s intending it to be a token of our promised
marriage. I am sending the ring, and I ask you to
wear it in remembrance of one who must remain forever
dead to you. The life of happiness we planned has turned
to Dead Sea fruit; for I have been struck by a bolt from
Heaven, and marriage becomes an impossibility. I would
explain myself more clearly if explanation were not an
insult. But I <i>must</i> say this&mdash;no man could have foreseen
the calamity which has befallen me, which has laid in wait<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
throughout the long years to overwhelm me at last. That
is all I dare tell you. Forgive me, dear one. I would
not willingly cause you a pang; but Fate is stronger than
I, and I am vanquished. Do you know me well enough
to accept this statement in its crude truth? It cannot be
gainsaid, it cannot be altered, time itself cannot assuage
its rigors. Do not write to me. I have no fear of reproach,
which would never come from your dear lips, but your
strong, brave words would wring my very heartstrings.
And yet, I love you, and will grieve till the end that you
should have been reft from me. Farewell, then, my dear
one.</p></div>

<p>Next morning he paid a visit to the clergy-house
connected with the cathedral on Fifth Avenue. He
asked a priest who received him if anything was known
of an old man named Rafferty, who lived on West 27th
Street, and had a grandson named Maguire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the ecclesiastic. &ldquo;I know Rafferty
well, and esteem him most highly. In all New York
there is no more God-fearing man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Power smiled. &ldquo;Fearing?&rdquo; he questioned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I accept the correction. &lsquo;Serving,&rsquo; I should
have said.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And he really exists?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Undoubtedly. Why do you ask?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I fancied that, perhaps, the age of miracles had
not passed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who says it has?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not I. But I come here for a specific purpose.
I mean to provide Rafferty with the sum of fifteen
dollars weekly while he lives, and, if his grandson recovers
from an accident he sustained yesterday, a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
further sum sufficient to maintain, clothe, and educate
the boy until he is taught a trade. My banker will
co-operate in a trust for this purpose. Will you, or
one of your brotherhood, act with him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus it came to pass that Rafferty, like Job, was
more prosperous in the end than in the beginning, and
died when he was &ldquo;old and full of days&rdquo;; but he had
lived five long years to bless the name of his benefactor.</p>

<p>That evening Power took train to the West. He
prepared MacGonigal for his coming by a telegram,
never thinking that an event which lay in the category
of common things for him meant something akin
to an earthquake at Bison. He was enlightened when
a brass band, &ldquo;headed by the mayor and a deputation
of influential citizens&rdquo; (see <i>Rocky Mountain News</i> of
current date) met him at Bison station, where an address
of welcome was read, the while MacGonigal and
Jake beamed on a cheering multitude. At first Power
was astonished and secretly annoyed; then he could not
help but yield to the genuine heartiness of this civic
welcome, which contrasted so markedly with his last
dismal home-coming. He made a modest speech, expressing
his real surprise at the community&rsquo;s progress,
and promising not to absent himself again for so long a
period.</p>

<p>Then he was escorted in a triumphal procession to
the ranch. It was the organizers&rsquo; intent that he should
sit in an open carriage in solitary state, in order that
thousands of people who had never seen him should
feast their eyes on &ldquo;the man who made Bison,&rdquo; while
it was felt that, if he were not distracted by conversation,
he would give more heed to local marvels in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
shape of trolley-cars, a town hall, a public library,
a &ldquo;Mary Power&rdquo; institute, and a whole township of
new avenues and streets.</p>

<p>But he declined emphatically to fall in with this
arrangement, and, if his subconscious mind were not
dwelling on less transient matters, might have been
much amused by noting how MacGonigal, Jake, and
the mayor (a man previously unknown to him) shared
the honors of the hour. Nothing could have proved
more distasteful personally than this joyous home-coming;
yet he went through the ordeal with a quiet
dignity that added to his popularity. For, singularly
enough, he had not been forgotten or ignored in Bison.
MacGonigal, the leader of every phase of local activity,
never spoke in public that he did not refer to
&ldquo;our chief citizen, John Darien Power,&rdquo; and his name
and personality figured in all matters effecting the
town&rsquo;s rapid development.</p>

<p>He was deeply touched when he found the ranch
exactly as he had left it. He imagined that Jake and
his family were living there; but the overseer had built
himself a fine house close at hand, and the Dolores
homestead was altered in no respect, save that it
seemed to have shrunk somewhat, owing to the growth
of the surrounding trees and shrubberies.</p>

<p>When, at last, he and MacGonigal were left together
in the room which was so intimately associated with
vital happenings in his career, his stout partner brought
off a remark which the ordered ceremony of the railroad
depot had not permitted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wall, ef I ain&rsquo;t dog-goned glad ter see ye ag&rsquo;in,
Derry!&rdquo; he said, holding forth a fat fist for another<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
handshake. &ldquo;But whar on airth did ye bury yerself?
Between yer friend Mr. Dacre an&rsquo; meself, the hull
blame world was s&rsquo;arched fer news of you; but you
couldn&rsquo;t hev vanished more completely ef Jonah&rsquo;s whale
had swallered you, or you&rsquo;d been carried up to Heaven
in a fiery chariot like Elijah.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello, Mac!&rdquo; cried Power, eying his elderly companion
with renewed interest. &ldquo;Whence this Biblical
flavor in your speech? Have you taken a much-needed
religious turn?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fer example, an&rsquo; that&rsquo;s a fac&rsquo;, Derry. Sence
you boosted me inter bein&rsquo; a notorious char-ac-ter, I&rsquo;ve
kind o&rsquo; lived up ter specification. Thar&rsquo;s no gettin&rsquo;
away from it. Ye can&rsquo;t deal out prizes to a row o&rsquo;
shiny-faced kids in a Sunday-school without larnin&rsquo;
some of the stock lingo, an&rsquo; bits of it stick. But don&rsquo;t
let&rsquo;s talk about me. I want ter hear about you. Whar
hev you been?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a long story, Mac, and will take some telling.
Just now, looking around at this room and its familiar
objects, my mind goes back through the years.
What did you say to Nancy when she wrote and asked
what had become of me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>MacGonigal, who had made quite a speech at the
reception, and had been unusually long-winded during
the drive, reverted suddenly to earlier habit.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s been openin&rsquo; old sores?&rdquo; he inquired.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No one. Nancy wrote to me before she died.
That is all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look-a here, Derry, why not leave it at that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Unhappily, I cannot do otherwise. But I have a
right to know exactly what happened.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t such a heap. She cabled an&rsquo; wrote, an&rsquo;
I had to tell her you was plumb crazy about&mdash;about
yer mother&rsquo;s death. That was the on&rsquo;y reason I could
hand out fer your disappearin&rsquo; act. Pore thing! Soon
after she got my letter she gev in her own checks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you met Marten recently?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was in Denver last fall.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the child&mdash;the little girl&mdash;did you see her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yep. Gosh, Derry, she&rsquo;s as like her mother as
two peas in a pod.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is Marten fond of her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Derry, that kid kin twist him round her little
finger; but he&rsquo;s a hard man ter move any other way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where does he live?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In Europe, fer the most part. He&rsquo;s out of mines
an&rsquo; rails&mdash;in the West, anyhow. Last I heerd, he was
puttin&rsquo; through a state loan fer the I-talians.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quite an international financier, eh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what the papers call him. Guess it&rsquo;s
Shakespeare&rsquo;s English fer a dog-goned shark.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know Willard is dead?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Know! Didn&rsquo;t I celebrate with a school-treat fer
two thousand kids?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mac! Haven&rsquo;t they taught you better than that
at your Sunday-schools?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thar&rsquo;s a proverb about skinnin&rsquo; a Rooshan an&rsquo;
findin&rsquo; a Tartar. That&rsquo;s me, all the time, when any
of that bunch shows up on the screen. What d&rsquo;ye
think Marten kem to Denver for?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t imagine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He wanted ter buy the ranch. No, not the mine,&rdquo;
for MacGonigal misread the amazement in Power<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>&rsquo;s
face, &ldquo;just the ranch. Said he was anxious for little
Nancy to own the property whar her mother lived as
a gal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what did you say&mdash;or do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Handed him a joint straight outer the refrigerator,
all fixed with mustard. &lsquo;Marten,&rsquo; says I, just
like that, &lsquo;Marten, ef you want yer little gal ter grow
up good an&rsquo; happy, don&rsquo;t let her suspicion thar&rsquo;s such
a place as Dolores on the map.&rsquo; &lsquo;Why?&rsquo; says he,
lookin&rsquo; black as thunder. &lsquo;Because,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;it&rsquo;s well
named when thar&rsquo;s one of the Willard family on the
location. Ef any children kin play around here an&rsquo;
be happy, they&rsquo;ll be Derry Power&rsquo;s, not yours.&rsquo; Sorry,
Derry, ef ye didn&rsquo;t wish me ter rile him; but, till you
was given up fer good, the one spot in Colorado his
money couldn&rsquo;t buy was this yer house an&rsquo; land.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And again did MacGonigal fail to interpret his hearer&rsquo;s
expression, nor did he ever understand the tragic
import of his words. The story of Nancy&rsquo;s transgression
was buried with her, and the grave seldom
gives up its secrets. Moreover, was she not nearly
seven years dead? And seven years of death count in
the scale of forgetfulness as against seventy and seven
of life.</p>

<h2><small>CHAPTER XVIII</small><br />

THE SECOND GENERATION</h2>


<p>Marguerite Sinclair did not write. Perhaps,
tucked away in a corner of Power&rsquo;s heart, a tender
little shoot of hope that she might be moved to disobedience
and revolt blossomed for awhile. But it
soon withered. She did not break the silence he had
imposed on her. The quiet weeks passed. The vessel
in which the girl and her father had traveled to London
had already returned to South America; but never
a word came from Marguerite. So far as externals
went, Power seemed to have settled down again to the
life of the student and the recluse from which he
had been so rudely withdrawn. Beyond a rearrangement
with Jake, whereby that pillar of the community
was given the stock-raising business, while Power retained
only the ranch, together with the paddocks and
orchards in its immediate vicinity, there was no change
in affairs at Bison. MacGonigal was offered a controlling
interest in the mine; but he scoffed at the proposal.
The proceeds of his third share would amount
to nearly quarter of a million dollars for the current
year, and his personal expenditure did not exceed a
fifth of that sum.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the Scot blood in me,&rdquo; he explained, when
people rallied him as to his saving habits. &ldquo;My great-grandfather
lost a sixpence one day in Belfast, an&rsquo; the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>
family has been makin&rsquo; good ever sence. Thar ain&rsquo;t
no sixpences here; so I run a dime bank. Another
thing,&rdquo; and his bulging eyes challenged dispute, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s
a bully fine notion ter let well enough alone. This yer
proposition is goin&rsquo; along O. K. Let her rip!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Power, of course, was accumulating wealth with
every turn of the rolls in the reduction mills. The
name of the mine became a standing joke in Colorado.
&ldquo;What price the El Pre&ccedil;o outfit?&rdquo; men would say,
and spoke with bated breath of the millions it would
bring in the open market. Not only were there almost
unlimited supplies of rich ore in sight, but the very
granite containing the main vein itself yielded handsomely
under low-grade treatment. It seemed impossible
that the undertaking should go wrong at any
stage. If water was tapped, it went to irrigate new
lands which MacGonigal had added to the ranch. If
a new shaft was sunk, sufficient pay-ore was taken out
of the excavation to meet the cost; whereas, in ninety-nine
mines among a hundred, the charge would have
fallen on capital.</p>

<p>For three months Power lay fallow at Dolores. His
bodily vigor was unimpaired; but his mind demanded
the restorative tonic of peace. A Chicago bookstore
sent him the hundred most important books which had
been published during his absence from civilization,
and, with their aid, he supplemented Marguerite&rsquo;s lessons,
and soon brought himself abreast of contemporary
thought. Beyond establishing a maternity hospital
in Bison, and renewing the grant to Dr. Stearn&rsquo;s
poor, he did not embark in philanthropic schemes to
any great extent. Still, he found pressing need of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
a secretary, and secured an excellent assistant in a
Harvard undergraduate, a young man whose brilliant
career in the university was brought to a dramatic
close by an automobile accident which crippled him
for life. He was one of the first victims of the new
force. Power had never seen a motor-car until he
reached New York. The industry had sprung into
being when he was immured in the Andes. Even yet
it was in the experimental stage, and his secretary,
Wilmot Richard Howard, was testing an improved
steering-gear when he was smashed up by a hostile
lumber wagon.</p>

<p>The post Power offered him was a veritable godsend,
and he, in his way, became infinitely useful to his employer.
A curious sympathy soon existed between
them. The limitations of Howard&rsquo;s maimed body
caused him to understand something of the cramped
outlook before Power&rsquo;s maimed soul. Moreover, within
a month, his wide reading and thorough acquaintance
with the world&rsquo;s current topics filled gaps in Power&rsquo;s
knowledge which books alone could not repair. When
Power quitted Bison in the spring of the year none
who did not know his history would ever have suspected
that he had dwelt so long apart from his fellow-men.</p>

<p>The two traveled together. Halting in New York
for a few hours only, they crossed the Atlantic in the
<i>Lucania</i>. They remained in London a week, living in
one of those small and most exclusive West End hotels
whose patrons come and go without the blare of trumpets
in the press which is the penalty, or reward, of
residence in the more noteworthy caravansaries. Lon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>don,
it is true, is the one city in the world where a
millionaire can mingle unnoticed with the crowd; but
Power took no risk of undue publicity. Once, in later
years, a newspaper discovered him, and blazoned forth
to all and sundry the status he occupied in Colorado;
thenceforth, Howard arranged matters in his own
name, and hotel managers and hall-porters bowed to
him as the holder of the purse.</p>

<p>From London, reinforced by a first-rate valet, the
pair went to Devon. There, in a wooded comb looking
out over the Atlantic, they found Dacre, the one
man living in whose ears Power could to some extent
unburden his heart. From him were forthcoming
certain details as to Nancy&rsquo;s end; for he had happened
to dine one evening with the physician who attended
her constantly after her arrival in England,
and the doctor, little guessing how well informed his
neighbor was as to Mrs. Marten&rsquo;s antecedents, had
entered into particulars of what he described as &ldquo;a
case that presented unusual and baffling features.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;From what he told me, I gathered that she must
have pined away from the moment she left you in
the Adirondacks,&rdquo; said Dacre. &ldquo;I realize now that
she not only fretted herself into a low state of health,
but practically gave her life to her child. No wonder
the doctor was puzzled! He could not diagnose
her ailment; for who would have suspected that a
young, beautiful, and rich woman was resolved to die?
Now, knowing what we do know, we can see that it
was better so. She would never again have lived with
Marten as his wife, and there was bound to be trouble
sooner or later. Dear lady! I have often thought<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
of her, and of you. Sometimes, when that most misleading
faculty called common sense urged that you,
too, must be dead, I have pictured your meeting in
the great beyond. Indeed, it is the hope of such reunions
that accounts for mortal belief in immortality.
Remember, I also have paced the Via Dolorosa, and
I prize those hours, above all others, in which I dream
of a kingdom where wrongs are adjusted by an all-wise
Intelligence, and the wretched failures of earthly
life are dislodged from memory by some divine anodyne.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was silence for awhile. The two men were
talking in a restful, old-fashioned room which commanded
a far-flung view of the Atlantic. Howard,
whose acute sensibility might always be trusted in such
moments, had betaken himself to the garden with an
amiable collie, and the friends were free to talk without
restraint.</p>

<p>Then Dacre essayed a cheerier note. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t
help dwelling on these things,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but I would
remind you that you are still a young man, and it is a
nice question, whether, when all is said and done, you
are justified in binding yourself forever to a pale ghost.
It is a poetic conceit; but the eugenist would tell you
that you ought to marry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall never marry,&rdquo; said Power.</p>

<p>Nancy&rsquo;s secret would be buried with him, and
that fact alone burked any reference to Marguerite
Sinclair. Dacre was exceedingly shrewd, and could
hardly fail to reach the correct conclusion if he heard
that &ldquo;the other woman&rdquo; did actually exist, and that
circumstances of recent discovery alone prevented the
contemplated marriage.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, well!&rdquo; sighed the older man, relapsing into
Power&rsquo;s mood. &ldquo;This is a genuine instance of the pot
advising the kettle not to be black. How do you purpose
spending your time?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you. I mean to do some good in the world.
But I have not come here to bore you with humane
projects. I&rsquo;ve not forgotten that you are a yachtsman.
Say you agree, and I&rsquo;ll hire a yacht to take us up the
west coast of Scotland and across the North Sea to
the fiords.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Spoken like a prince! It is the very thing I&rsquo;m
longing for; but my purse won&rsquo;t run to it, and I&rsquo;m
rather too old to fraternize with Cockney excursionists
on David MacBrayne&rsquo;s steamers or Cook&rsquo;s tourists in
Norway.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the friends passed an enjoyable summer, and
liked the yacht so well that they cruised south by
way of Holland, Belgium, and France, and wintered
in the Mediterranean. Then Power and his secretary
hied them to Bison again; whence their next journey
headed east. They visited flower-laden Honolulu,
panting Japan, gray China, and golden India. Pitching
his tent where he listed, Power saw mankind in
the mass. Everywhere, even in climes where Nature
is prodigal of her gifts, there was misery to be softened,
suffering to be alleviated, men and women in
want and worthy of help. His methods were simple
in the extreme. Attracting little or no attention by
display of wealth, he and Howard studied every problem
that seemed to call for solution by money wisely
applied. At the last moment&mdash;often when he had departed
to some far distant place&mdash;Power would send<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>
the needed sum to the right quarter. Thus, remaining
almost unknown, he left a trail of well-doing behind
him in the four corners of the globe. Sometimes,
when the written or printed word insisted on making
him famous, if Bison was too remote a sanctuary, he
would disappear for many months on end, either hobnobbing
with Dacre in Devonshire or elsewhere, or
taking protracted tours in out-of-the-way countries
like East Africa, Siberia, or the Balkans.</p>

<p>Naturally, he had adventures and misadventures.
No man can scour the earth, year in and year out&mdash;be
he rich as Cr&#339;sus or kindly as Francis d&rsquo;Assisi&mdash;without
enduring vicissitudes, whether they arise
from the haphazard casualties of travel or are the
outcome of sheer human perversity.</p>

<p>In Nairobi, he had the narrowest escape from being
mauled by a lion; his boat was wrecked in a rapid of
the Yang-tse-Kiang, and a Chinese coolie saved him
from death by diving after him when he sank, stunned
by collision with a rock; in the town of Omsk, in Eastern
Siberia, he was lodged in a fever-stricken prison
for interfering between a brutal Cossack officer and
a female political prisoner whom the man was flogging
mercilessly with a knout. On this occasion Howard
rescued him by bribing every official in sight. His
worst experience came in a Rumelian Christian village.
Howard found that certain saline mud baths on
the coast of the Adriatic exercised a highly beneficial
effect on his injured spine; so Power left him there,
to undergo a complete course of treatment, and traveled
alone in the interior. By ill luck, he was benighted
in a miserable hamlet near Adrianople. Dur<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>ing
the night the Turkish authorities learned that
smallpox was rife among the inhabitants. They established
a cordon, and drove back at the point of the
bayonet all who attempted to leave the place. For
six weeks Power lived in a pesthouse; but the Andean
sap rose again in his bones, and he reorganized the habits
of the community so thoroughly that its survivors
regarded him as a man sent by God for their
deliverance.</p>

<p>Thus, doing good by stealth, and ever widening his
knowledge of mankind, he passed thirteen busy years.
It would serve no useful purpose to go more fully into
the records of that long and fruitful period of his life.
Though crammed with incident and rich in the vivid
tints of travel in many lands, it calls for none other
than the briefest summary in a narrative which, at
the best, can deal only with the chief phases of a
remarkable career.</p>

<p>He was in his forty-eighth year, and was paying a
deferred visit to Dacre, when he entered upon the last,
and in some respects the greatest, of his trials. Howard
was in London, showing the sights to some relations,
and Power had elected to motor to Devonshire.
His chauffeur, a tall, well-built youngster who answered
to the name of Maguire&mdash;being, in fact, Rafferty&rsquo;s
grandson&mdash;was eager to test a car which was
supposed to possess every mechanical virtue, and
Power was not disinclined for the run through a June
England. Nothing daunted by the prospect of twelve
hours&rsquo; continuous excess of the speed limit, master
and man determined to reach Devonshire in the day.
But the machine decided differently. Two burst tires<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>
cost them a couple of hours on the road, and a speck
of grit in a valve caused such trouble that it became
necessary to stop for the night in a town where careful
overhauling of the engine was practicable; so they
ran slowly into Bournemouth, and there, in one of the
big hotels on the cliff, Power met his own daughter.</p>

<p>He thought, and not without reason, that he was
the victim of hallucination. He had halted for a moment
in a soft-carpeted corridor to look at a spirited
painting of wild ponies in the New Forest, when
a door opened close at hand. He heard no footstep;
but the rustle of a dress caught his ear, and he moved
aside to permit the passing of some lady of whose
presence he was only half conscious. But a sudden
impulse&mdash;perhaps due to the action of the magnetic
waves which link certain kindred individualities without
their personal cognizance&mdash;caused him to turn
and look at the stranger, and he saw&mdash;Nancy!</p>

<p>The light in the corridor was dim&mdash;for instance,
he had been obliged to peer closely at the picture
before he could decipher the artist&rsquo;s signature&mdash;but
there was no mistaking the extraordinary resemblance
which this girl bore to the Nancy Willard of the
Dolores Ranch days, the Nancy with whom he used
to gallop along prairie tracks where now ran the steel
ribbons of electrically propelled street-cars, Nancy as
he knew her before he had won and lost her twice.</p>

<p>The shock of recognition was so unexpected that
he reeled under it. Then, seeing that the girl was evidently
wondering why he was looking at her so
strangely, he forced himself to walk on toward his
own apartment.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span></p>

<p>There, when calmer thought became possible, he
realized that he had seen Nancy&rsquo;s child, a girl now in her
twentieth year. She was so like her mother at the
same age that there was no possibility of error on
his part. The same glory of golden-brown hair, the
same changeful eyes of blende Kagoul blue, the same
winsome features, the same graceful carriage&mdash;he could
not be mistaken. And, to make more fierce the fire
that was consuming him, he had again found a subtle
hint of Marguerite Sinclair in the sprightly maid who
had passed him so silently and swiftly. He smiled with
a sort of bitter weariness when it dawned on him that
this vision would probably control the future course
of his life. He was face to face with Destiny again.
There was less chance of escape for him now than for
the sailor swept from the gale-submerged deck of a
tramp steamer in mid-Atlantic, because miracles did
sometimes happen at sea; but, where he was concerned,
Fate planted her snares so cunningly that he was always
fast pinioned before he even suspected their
existence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am fey today. I peer into a dim future. Some
day, somehow, you will understand that which is hidden
from my ken.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He could not comprehend the full meaning of those
words yet; but the day of reckoning was at hand.
Well, it was better so. Surely the settlement would be
final this time!</p>

<p>He was minded to dine in privacy; but he was no
coward, and the inclination was dismissed as unworthy.
So he dressed with care, reached the crowded dining-room
rather late, and was allotted to a small table<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
near a window. In that particular window was a
party of six, and among them were Marten and the
girl. She raised her eyes when Power entered, and
a look of recognition came into them. On her right
sat a small, polished, olive-skinned man, who seemed
to be more engrossed in her company than she in his.
The faces of these three were clearly visible from Power&rsquo;s
place; the others, two women and a man, were
not so much in evidence.</p>

<p>He strove to catch some of the girl&rsquo;s accents; but
she spoke but little, and that in a low tone. She gave
him the impression of being among people whom she
disliked, but whose presence had to be endured. Once
or twice she addressed Marten, and then her manner
reminded him more than ever of her mother. To all
appearance, father and daughter were wrapped up in
each other, and Power knew not whether to rejoice or
be sad because of it. Martin looked old and worn.
He showed every one of his sixty years. The burden
of finance may be even weightier than that of empire.</p>

<p>Power&rsquo;s mind ran back to the night, just twenty
years before, when he sat at a table in another hotel and
found Nancy Marten gazing at him. Skies and times
may change, but not manners. He had met mother and
daughter under precisely similar conditions, save that
he was alone now, and a complete stranger to the girl.
Marten was so taken up with his friends that he gave
no attention to others in the room. Perhaps he had
trained himself to that useful habit. At any rate, he
glanced Power&rsquo;s way only once, and obviously regarded
him as one among the well-dressed throng.</p>

<p>Later, in a lounge where people smoked, chatted,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
drank coffee, or played bridge to the accompaniment
of an excellent band, Power contrived to pass close behind
the girl&rsquo;s chair. She was with one of the women
now, and talking animatedly. Yes, she had her mother&rsquo;s
voice! What long dormant chords of memory it
touched! How it vibrated through heart and brain!
Nancy&mdash;dead and yet speaking!</p>

<p>Next morning the car, in chastened mood, bore him
smoothly and quickly away through the Hampshire
pines and the blossom-laden hedges of Somerset. He
reached Dacre&rsquo;s house early in the afternoon, and was
somewhat surprised when his friend suggested that they
should start forthwith on a rambling tour up the Wye
Valley and thus to the lakes by way of North Wales.</p>

<p>This spirit of unrest was so unlike Dacre&rsquo;s wonted
air of repose that it evoked a question.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have just come here to escape from the ceaseless
rush of things,&rdquo; said Power. &ldquo;Why do you want
to bustle me off so promptly?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought a change of scene might be good for
both of us,&rdquo; was the offhand answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yet it is only a week since you wrote and
reproached me for neglecting the Devon moors. I can
slay you with your own quotation. You bade me join
you in&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">
&lsquo;This other Eden, demi-paradise,<br />
This fortress built by Nature for herself&rsquo;&mdash;<br />
</p>

<p class="noidt">and now you would have us cavort along dusty highways
to other joys. Why is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My quotation applied to the whole of this sceptered
isle.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are quibbling, Dacre, and I think I guess the
reason. Have you heard anything of Marten recently?&rdquo;</p>

<p>His companion did not try to conceal the surprise
that leaped to his eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your Indians made you a bit of wizard,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you now what I meant to hide from you.
Marten has rented Lord Valescure&rsquo;s place on the hill
yonder, and is due here tomorrow or next day. I
heard the name of the new tenant only this morning,
and decided that we ought to quit if we want to be
happy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. If you&rsquo;ll let me, I&rsquo;ll remain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it wise?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I endured the major wrench last night. Marten
and&mdash;and his daughter were staying in the same hotel
as myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you have seen her&mdash;at last?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and I&rsquo;ll confess my weakness. Having seen
her, I wish to speak to her. I admit my folly; but I
cannot help it. Somehow&mdash;I think&mdash;that her mother&mdash;would
wish it. I&rsquo;ll placate Marten, grovel to him, if
I may be allowed to meet her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear Derry, I&rsquo;ve said my say. You ought to
have lived two thousand years ago, and Euripides
would have immortalized you in a tragedy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The eyes of the two men clashed; but Power repressed
the imminent request for an explanation of
that cryptic remark. He dared not ask what Dacre
had in mind. His comment might have been a chance
shaft; but it fell dangerously near the forbidden territory
of Nancy&rsquo;s close-veiled secret. When next he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>
spoke, it was to give a motorist&rsquo;s account of the mishaps
of the road.</p>

<p>A week passed. Dacre&rsquo;s house lay halfway up a
wooded comb, or valley, and the Valescure castle stood
on a bold tor that thrust itself bluntly into the sea.
Unless the occupants of each place were on friendly
terms, they might dwell in the same district and not
meet once in a year. By taking a rough path they
were barely three-quarters of a mile apart; but the
only practicable carriage-road covered three miles or
more. Dacre&rsquo;s interests lay with the fisher-folk at the
foot of the comb or among the woods and heather
of Dartmoor Forest, rolling up into the clouds behind
his abode, while the great folk of the castle seldom
came his way, unless Lord Valescure happened to be
in residence, when the two forgathered often.</p>

<p>But Dacre was right when he hinted at the tragic
inevitableness of his friend&rsquo;s life. They had strolled
into the rectory for tea, and were chatting with their
hostess about a forthcoming charity f&ecirc;te, when a motor
rumbled to the door, and Nancy Marten appeared, a
radiant vision in the muslin and flower-decked hat of
summer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How kind of you to come!&rdquo; said the rector&rsquo;s wife,
rising to greet the girl. &ldquo;Lady Valescure said she
was sure I might write and seek your help for our
village revel. She said all sorts of nice things about
you, and now I know they are true.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Power was introduced to &ldquo;Miss Marten,&rdquo; and the
girl gave him one of those shy yet delightfully candid
glances which he remembered so well in her mother&rsquo;s
eyes.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I meet you recently in the corridor of a
hotel at Bournemouth?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you will be surprised to hear that you rather
startled me. I thought you were about to fall, and
was on the point of catching your arm when you
walked away. Then I saw you had a slight limp,
and it was that which had probably caused my stupid
notion. Wouldn&rsquo;t you have been tremendously astonished
if a giddy young person had clutched you suddenly
and implored you not to drop at her feet?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yet I can well imagine any man, especially a
younger sprig than myself, being moved to some such
act of homage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She laughed&mdash;Nancy again!</p>

<p>&ldquo;There seems to be no end of men in England who
can pay neat compliments to a woman,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But
you&rsquo;re not an Englishman, Mr. Power. Aren&rsquo;t you a
fellow-countryman of mine?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How jolly! People never guess it, but I&rsquo;m an
American; though I can never be President, even if we
women get a vote, because I was born in London. But
my parents hail from the Silver State.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where more gold is produced than in any other
state of the Union.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you know Colorado?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. Better than that, I knew your mother many
years ago, before her marriage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You knew my mother&mdash;in Colorado&mdash;on the ranch!
Well!&rdquo; She turned rapidly to her hostess. &ldquo;Thank
you ever so much for inviting me here today. I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>&rsquo;ll
work like a slave for your bazaar. Here is the man
I&rsquo;ve been aching to meet ever since I was able to talk.
Please don&rsquo;t think me rude if I monopolize him all the
afternoon. I&rsquo;m going to take him off to that nice shady
seat under the copper beech, and question him until he
cries for mercy.... Yes, please. Tea, with sugar
and milk, and lots of bread and butter, piled high with
Devonshire cream and jam&mdash;all the good things!
Why, you&rsquo;re a veritable fairy princess. Mr. Power
met my mother when she was a girl!... Come along,
Mr. Power! No wonder I was inclined to grab you
in that corridor. Oh, had I but guessed! I&rsquo;ll never,
never distrust intuition again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To begin with,&rdquo; said Power, as he walked with
her across the springy turf with a laden tray in his
hands, &ldquo;in what way did intuition prompt you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind telling you at once. I feel I can
talk to you as though we had known each other always.
I said you rather startled me; but that was
just a polite way of saying what I didn&rsquo;t exactly mean.
You were examining a picture, and you turned unexpectedly
and looked at me. There was an expression
in your eyes that gave me a sort of shock, one of those
emotional thrills which cannot be described in words.
You might have been gazing at the ghost of someone
very dear to you. Ah, forgive me if my tongue runs
away with me, but I&rsquo;m really excited. Of course, I
understand now. You took me for my mother. And I
am like her, am I not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So like that your first impression was right. I did
nearly fall. The least push would have toppled me
over. It was only the iron law of convention that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>
enabled me to pass on as though nothing unusual had
happened.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then my mother and you were great friends?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You met her long before she was married?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say yes, and leave it at that. Tell me
things&mdash;everything you think I would like to know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I may tell you this, without the slightest unfairness
to&mdash;to your father. I loved your mother; but
I was poor in those days, and dared not ask her to
marry me. Then I was sent away to a distant mine&mdash;and&mdash;we
drifted apart. When next I saw her she was
a wife. Now, suppose we forget that bit of ancient
history&mdash;because I hope to become friendly with your
father&mdash;for your sake.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girl&rsquo;s eyes were glistening, and she had lost some
of her exquisite color.</p>

<p>She understood, or thought she understood; though
she little dreamed what fierce longings, what vain regrets,
were surging through the man&rsquo;s inmost core.
Her quick intelligence noted certain slight hesitancies
in his speech, which the ever-present feminine sense of
romance attributed to tender recollections of the bygone
days. With ready sympathy, she led him to talk
of the ranch, of Bison, even of her grandfather, whom
she remembered but vaguely.</p>

<p>Power kept a close guard on his words, and easily
focused her interest on topics which could not prove
hurtful, even if she repeated the conversation to Marten
in its entirety. Once only did their chat veer round
to a dangerous quarter.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;You said you saw my mother again after her marriage&mdash;where
was that?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In Newport, Rhode Island. I went there to buy
horses, and we met unexpectedly in a hotel, just as you
and I the other evening.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was she&mdash;was she happy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course she was happy. She was one of the
most beautiful women of her day, and married to a
rich man who was certainly devoted to her. She moved
in the best society, both in America and in Europe.
By the way, her closest friends were the Van Raltens
in the States and the Duchesse de Brasnes in Paris.
Have you ever come across any members of those
families?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know Mrs. Van Ralten very well. Her daughter
was at school with me at Brussels.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then Mr. Marten hardened his heart, and parted
from you for a time?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. I see now that it was bad for a girl to
be always at home or in hotels, with governesses. Fortunately,
Father had to be away a good deal, in Russia
and elsewhere; so I was sent to school, where I was
taught what little I know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus was an unforeseen shoal safely navigated,
and Power took care that Newport was lost sight
of. As he and Dacre walked up the valley to
their abode, the latter broke a long silence by saying:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Again I ask, Derry&mdash;is it wise?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And again I answer that years of suffering entitle
one to the fleeting pleasure of seeing and speaking to
Nancy&rsquo;s daughter.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But she is Marten&rsquo;s daughter, too, and he may
prove difficult.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let him. I have fought stronger adversaries, and
won through in the end.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Secretary Howard joined them that night. After
dinner he inquired if Power had ever had any dealings
with Mowlem &amp; Son, a firm of lawyers in New
York.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Power. &ldquo;The name is not familiar to
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Queer thing! A man who represented himself as
their London agent called at my hotel yesterday and
inquired if it was correct that you were in Devonshire.
I said yes, and asked his business. He explained
that Mowlem &amp; Son wanted to know, and that was all
he could, or would, tell me. I was inclined to believe
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps it is the usual hue and cry after a bloated
capitalist.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I rather fancy not. This fellow seemed to lay
stress on your presence here. Besides, the company-promoting
crowd have learned long since that you are
unapproachable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;At such a moment one might mention a peak in
Darien,&rdquo; laughed Dacre, and the incident lapsed into
the limbo of insignificant happenings.</p>

<p>Thenceforth Power met Nancy day after day. The
approaching f&ecirc;te supplied the girl with a ready excuse
for these regular visits to village and rectory. Power
believed, though he did not seek enlightenment, that
she had not spoken of him to her father. One day, when
she was accompanied by the sleek, olive-skinned man<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>
he had seen at Bournemouth, she rather avoided him,
and he ascertained from an awe-stricken rustic that
the stranger was a prince, but of what dynasty his informant
could not say.</p>

<p>At their next meeting he rallied the girl on her aloofness.
She withered him with an indignant glance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come!&rdquo; she said imperiously, taking him from the
schoolhouse in which a committee was assembled, and
making for the tiny stone pier which sheltered a small
estuary from southwesterly gales.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to tell you some day, and you may as well
know now,&rdquo; she said, with a curious hardness of tone
which she had probably acquired from Marten by the
trick of association. &ldquo;You loved my mother, and
ought to have married her. If all was nice and providential
in the best of all possible worlds, you would
have been my father. Oh, you needn&rsquo;t flinch because
I say that! If you <i>were</i> my father, I&rsquo;m sure you
wouldn&rsquo;t force me to marry a man I detest. That person
who came with me yesterday is the high and
mighty Principe del Montecastello. I have to marry
him, and I hate him!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Power&rsquo;s face went very pale. His hour had struck.
He looked out over a smiling ocean; but the eyes of
his soul saw a broken vista of barren hills, snow-crowned
and glacier-ribbed, while howling torrents rushed
through the depths of ravines choken with the d&eacute;bris
of avalanches and rotting pines. His own voice
sounded hollow and forlorn in his ears.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In these days no woman need marry a man she
hates,&rdquo; he was saying, aware of a dull effort to ward
off a waking nightmare by the spoken word.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;You know better than that,&rdquo; she retorted, with
the bitter logic of youth. &ldquo;What am I to do? The
man I love, and would marry if I could, is poor. He
is too honorable to&mdash;to&mdash;&mdash; Oh, I don&rsquo;t know what
I mean&mdash;only this, that a millionaire&rsquo;s daughter can
be bought and sold like any other girl, even a princess,
when what men call &lsquo;important interests&rsquo; are at
stake.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You say you have chosen another man?&rdquo; he said
brokenly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, the dearest boy. Oh, Mr. Power, I wish you
knew him! I have faith in you. Perhaps you could
help&mdash;if only for my dear mother&rsquo;s safe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She was crying now; but her streaming eyes sought
his with wistful confidence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. I will help, for your dear mother&rsquo;s sake,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;Be brave, and drive away those tears. They&mdash;they
hurt. I&mdash;I saw your mother crying once.
Now tell me everything. If I would be of any real
assistance, I must know how to shape my efforts.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><small>CHAPTER XIX</small><br />

THE SETTLEMENT</h2>


<p>Nancy&rsquo;s pitiful little story was soon told. During
the last year she had often met the Honorable Philip
Lindsay, second son of an impoverished Scottish peer,
and now a lieutenant in a line regiment stationed at
Aldershot. They discovered each other, in the first
instance, at a hunt ball in Leicestershire, and a simple
confusion of names led the man to believe that the
pretty girl with the blue eyes was the hired companion
of the daughters of the family with whom she
was staying. Her friends&mdash;like herself, just emancipated
from the schoolroom&mdash;fostered the deception,
which she and they found amusing; but Lindsay&rsquo;s Celtic
blood was fired by the knowledge that he had found
the one woman in the world he wanted to marry, be
she poor as Cinderella. Before the girl realized that
the handsome young soldier was not of the carpet-knight
type, he was telling her he loved her, and asking
her to wait for him till he got his captaincy or secured
an adjutant&rsquo;s berth in a territorial battalion, and they
would wed.</p>

<p>Of course, there were explanations, and tears, and
a good deal of the white-lipped tragedy of youth.
Lindsay, like a gallant gentleman, refused to be dubbed
a fortune-hunter, and went back to his regiment, where
he threw himself into the dissipation of musketry in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span>struction
with a cold fury that surprised and gratified
his colonel. Then Nancy found that her heart had
gone with him, and wrote a tearful request that they
might never meet again; whereupon the sprite who controls
these affairs brought Marten and his daughter to
a grand review at Windsor&mdash;and who should be on some
notable general&rsquo;s staff but Lieutenant the Honorable
Philip Lindsay? After that the veriest tyro in the
methods of romance must see that the general would
invite the American millionaire to dine with him that
evening, and that Lindsay should be allotted to Nancy
as her dinner partner.</p>

<p>There were thrills, and flashing glances; but Caledonia
remained both stern and wild, with the certain
result that he and the girl grew more desperately
enamoured of each other than ever.</p>

<p>But this is not the love-story of a new Derry and
another Nancy; so it may be taken for granted that
twenty-four and nineteen were suffering the approved
pangs, and were given every opportunity to develop
the recognized symptoms. Our real concern lies with
a man of middle age, around whom these minor happenings
revolved like comets around the sun&mdash;itself
ever fleeting into stellar depths. Not that Power felt
any resemblance to a star of magnitude at that time.
Though he never doubted that he was again at the
mercy of irresistible forces, dragging him he knew not
whither, the simile that presented itself to his mind
was that of a log being swept over a cataract. Despite
his brave promise to the weeping girl, he had
no plan, no hope of successful intervention. He caught
at one straw as the swirling current gripped him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>
This Italian prince might be a very excellent fellow,
and the soldier a bit of knave; then it would be his
bounden duty to exhort Nancy to filial obedience, that
time-honored principle productive of so much good and
so great evils.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is Mr. Lindsay&rsquo;s address?&rdquo; he inquired.</p>

<p>She told him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And is there any real need for present anxiety?
You are far too young to think of marriage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Father says my mother was wed at twenty. He
got rather angry when I retorted that she died at
twenty-four. But the real trouble is that that horrid
Giovanni Montecastello is pressing for an engagement.
Father spoke of it this morning. No wonder I am in
such a rebellious mood!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does Mr. Marten know Lindsay?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. He regards him merely as one of the thousand
nice young men one meets in London society.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is not aware of his attachment for you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She raised her hands in horror. Clearly, Hugh
Marten was master in his own household. His daughter
might be the apple of his eye; but he brooked no
interference with his perfected schemes, even from
her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At any rate,&rdquo; persisted Power, &ldquo;he will not compel
you to accept Prince Montecastello tomorrow, or
next day. Can&rsquo;t you hold out until, say, your twentieth
birthday?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This morning I promised to decide within a
month.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what did he say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He smiled, and remarked that I chose my words<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>
carelessly. Evidently I meant &lsquo;accept&rsquo; when I said
&lsquo;decide.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, then, we have a month. Great things can
be achieved in that time. Fortresses which have taken
ten years to build have fallen in a day. So be of
good cheer. I begin the attack at once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you please tell me what you intend doing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Firstly, I must see my army, which is composed
of one man, Philip Lindsay. Secondly, we must call on
the citadel to surrender. Your father is not aware
that Mr. Lindsay may be his prospective son-in-law.
He must be enlightened.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There will be an awful row,&rdquo; declared Nancy, unconsciously
reverting to the slang of a dismayed schoolgirl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The capture of a stronghold is usually accompanied
by noise and clamor. What matter, so long as
it yields?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And afterward?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Afterward, like every prudent general, I shall be
guided by events. Come, now; we&rsquo;ll go down to the
beach, and you shall dab your eyes with salt-water.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that a recipe to cure red eyes?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an excuse for blue ones showing a red tint.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girl smiled pathetically. &ldquo;Somehow,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;I always feel comforted after a talk with you. You
haven&rsquo;t known it, Mr. Power; for I have been forced to
conceal my troubles; but every time we meet you send
me away in a more assured frame of mind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She, in turn, did not know that he winced as if she
had struck him. Truly, he was paying a heavy reckoning
for the frenzy and passion of those far-off days<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span>
in the Adirondacks, and, worst of all, the seeming ashes
of that ardent fire threatened to blaze out anew.</p>

<p>As they walked back to the village they encountered
a well-dressed man, a stranger. By this time
Power was so thoroughly acquainted with the little
hamlet&rsquo;s inhabitants that he recognized some by name
and all by sight; but this man was unknown to him.</p>

<p>That evening Howard said, &ldquo;By the way, you remember
an inquiry from Mowlem &amp; Son, New York?
The man who made it was in the village today. I saw
him, soon after Miss Marten and you strolled on to the
beach.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Power described the stranger, and Howard identified
him; but the matter was dismissed as a trivial coincidence.
Indeed, Power had affairs of moment to occupy
him. Dacre, it appeared, was primed with facts
concerning the Principe del Montecastello.</p>

<p>&ldquo;His people are the famous Lombardy bankers,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;I have an idea, based on ethnological
theories, that they belonged originally to one of the
ten tribes; but they were ennobled during the seventeenth
century, and remained highly orthodox Blacks
till the present king came to the throne, when they
&rsquo;verted to the Whites.<a name="FNanchor_A_2" id="FNanchor_A_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_2" class="fnanchor">*</a> I believe that this change
came about owing to their association with Marten in
an Italian loan. Anyhow, the existing scion of the
princely house is rather a bad hat. Why are you interested
in him?&rdquo;</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_A_2" id="Footnote_A_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_2"><span class="label">*</span></a> The Papal and Constitutional parties in Italy are often differentiated
thus briefly.</p></div>

<p>&ldquo;He is a suitor for the hand of a young lady whose
welfare I have at heart.&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Not Nancy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The devil he is!&rdquo; and Dacre expressed his sentiments
freely. &ldquo;Why, I&rsquo;d prefer she married our local
road-mender; because then, at least, she would have
a decent, clean-minded husband. Marten must be losing
grip. Confound it! Why doesn&rsquo;t he go to Paris
or Naples, and find out this fellow&rsquo;s antecedents? I
feel it&rsquo;s absurd to doubt you, but can you really trust
your informant?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have it from Nancy&rsquo;s own lips.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, dash it all! Can nothing be done to stop it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Much, I hope. Tell Howard what you know, and
he will start for the Continent at once to verify it.
Meanwhile, may I invite a friend to come here tomorrow?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Need you ask? We can put up six more at a
pinch. But I can&rsquo;t get over Montecastello&rsquo;s infernal
impertinence. Yet, it&rsquo;s fully in accordance with Italian
standards of right and wrong. Your young count
or princeling can live like a pig until matrimony crops
up. Then he becomes mighty particular. The bride
must bring not only her dowry, but an unblemished
record as well. I suppose, in the long run, it is a wise
thing. Were it not for some such proviso, half the
aristocracy of Europe would disappear in two generations.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Power passed no comment; but he sent the following
letter by the night post:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;Dear Mr. Lindsay.&mdash;Miss Nancy Marten, who is staying
at Valescure Castle, near this house, has honored me<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>
by asking my advice and help in a matter that concerns
herself and you. She has done this because I am her friend,
and was her mother&rsquo;s friend years ago in Colorado. Can
you get leave from your regiment for a few days, and come
here? I believe you army men can plead urgent private
affairs, and there is little doubt as to the urgency and privacy
of this request. I make one stipulation. You are
not to communicate with Miss Nancy Marten until you have
seen me.</p>

<p class="ralign">
<span style="margin-right: 6em;">&ldquo;Sincerely yours,</span><br />
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">John Darien Power</span>.&rdquo;<br />
</p></div>

<p>He passed a troubled and sleepless night. Dacre&rsquo;s
careless if heated words had sunk deep. They chimed
in oddly with a thought that was not to be stilled, a
thought that had its genesis in a faded letter written
twenty years ago.</p>

<p>When Howard went to London next day he took with
him a cablegram, part in code and part in plain English.
It&rsquo;s text was of a peculiarity that forbade
the use of a village postoffice; for it ran, when
decoded:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;MacGonigal, Bison, Colorado.&mdash;Break open the locked
upper right-hand drawer of the Japanese cabinet in sitting-room,
Dolores, and send immediately by registered mail the
long sealed envelop marked &lsquo;To be burnt, unopened, by my
executors,&rsquo; and signed by me.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>Then followed Power&rsquo;s code signature and his
address.</p>

<p>A telegram arrived early. It read:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="" width="100%">
<tr><td align='left'>&ldquo;Will be with you 4.30 today.</td><td align='right'><span class="smcap">Lindsay.</span>&rdquo;</td></tr>
</table>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span></p>

<p>So the witches&rsquo; caldron was a-boil, and none might
tell what strange brew it would produce.</p>

<p>Lindsay came. Nancy had described him aptly.
The British army seems to turn out a certain type of
tall, straight, clean-limbed, and clear-eyed young officer
as though he were cast in a mold. Power appraised
him rightly at the first glance&mdash;a gentleman,
who held honor dear and life cheap, a man of high
lineage and honest mind, a Scot with a fox-hunting
strain in him, a youngster who would put his horse
at a shire fence or lead his company in a forlorn hope
with equal nonchalance and determination&mdash;not, perhaps,
markedly intellectual, but a direct descendant of
a long line of cavaliers whose all-sufficing motto was,
&ldquo;God, and the King.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The two had a protracted discussion. Power felt
that he must win this somewhat reserved wooer&rsquo;s confidence
before he broached the astounding project he
had formed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I take it,&rdquo; he said, at last, seeing that Lindsay was
convinced he meant well to Nancy, &ldquo;I take it Lord
Colonsay cannot supplement the small allowance he
now makes you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. It&rsquo;s not to be thought of. Scottish estates
grow poorer every decade. Even now Dad makes no
pretense of supporting a title. He lives very quietly,
and is hard put to it to give me a couple of hundred
a year.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I can&rsquo;t see how you can expect to marry the
daughter of a very rich man like Hugh Marten.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Heaven help me, neither do I!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yet you have contrived to fall in love with her?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That was beyond my control. She has told you
what happened. I fought hard against what the world
calls a piece of folly. I&mdash;avoided her. There is, there
can be, no sort of engagement between us, unless&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Unless what?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, it is a stupid thing to say, but you American
millionaires do occasionally get hipped by the other
fellow. If Marten came a cropper, I&rsquo;d have my
chance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Power laughed quietly. &ldquo;You are a true Briton,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;You think there is no security for money
except in trustee stocks. Well, I won&rsquo;t disturb your
faith. Now, I want you to call on Mr. Marten tomorrow
and ask him formally for his daughter&rsquo;s hand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then the fat <i>will</i> be in the fire.&rdquo; Evidently, Philip
and Nancy were well mated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Possibly; but it is the proper thing to do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, Mr. Power, you can&rsquo;t have considered your
suggestion fully. Suppose Mr. Marten even condescends
to listen? His first question floors me. I have
my pay and two hundred a year. I don&rsquo;t know a
great deal about the cost of ladies&rsquo; clothes, but I rather
imagine my little lot would about buy Nancy&rsquo;s hats.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In this changeable climate she would certainly
catch a severe cold. But you are going to tell Mr.
Marten that the day you and Nancy sign a marriage
contract your father will settle half a million sterling
on you, and half a million on Nancy. So the fat
spilled in the fire should cause a really fine flare-up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Military training confers calmness and self-control
in an emergency; but the Honorable Philip Lindsay ob<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span>viously
thought that his new friend had suddenly gone
mad.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I really thought you understood the position,&rdquo; he
began again laboriously. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t gone into the
calculation, but I should say, offhand, that our place in
Scotland wouldn&rsquo;t yield half a million potatoes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To speak plainly, then, I mean to give you the
money; but it must come through the Earl of Colonsay.
Further, if Marten hums and haws about the amount,
ascertain what sum will satisfy him. A million between
you, in hard cash, ought to suffice, because Marten has
many millions of his own.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lindsay could not choose but believe; for Power had
an extra measure of the faculty of convincing his
fellow-men. He stammered, almost dumfounded:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You make a most generous offer, an amazingly
generous one. You almost deprive me of words. But
I must ask&mdash;why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because, had life been kinder, Nancy would have
been my daughter and not Marten&rsquo;s. Yours is a proper
question, and I have answered it; so I hope you will
leave my explanation just where it stands. I mean to
enlighten you more fully in one respect. Your host,
Mr. Dacre, is a well-known man, and you will probably
accept what he says as correct. After dinner
I shall ask him to tell you that I can provide a million
sterling on any given date without difficulty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mad as it sounds, Mr. Power, I believe you implicitly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must get rid of that habit where money is
concerned. If you appease Mr. Marten, you will have
control of a great sum, and you should learn at the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>
outset to take no man&rsquo;s unsupported word regarding
its disposal or investment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lindsay went to his room with the manner of a man
walking on air. Nothing that he had ever heard or
read compared in any degree with the fantastic events
of the last hour. He could not help accepting Power&rsquo;s
statement; yet every lesson of life combated its credibility.
It is not surprising, therefore, that he should
be nervous and distrait when he reappeared; but Dacre
soon put him at ease.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Power has been telling me how he took your breath
away, Mr. Lindsay,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But that is a way
he has. When you and he are better acquainted you
will cease to marvel at anything he says, or does. On
this one point, however, I want to speak quite emphatically.
Mr. Power is certainly in a position to
give you a million pounds if he chooses, and, bearing
in mind the history of his early life, and the high
esteem in which he held Nancy Marten&rsquo;s mother, I can
sympathize with and appreciate the motives which inspire
his present effort to secure that young lady&rsquo;s
happy marriage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But this incident is set down here merely to show
how Power tried to make smooth the way by using his
wealth. He himself placed no reliance in its efficacy.
Lindsay went to Valescure Castle in high feather; but
came back angered and perplexed. Marten had listened
politely. There was not the least semblance of
annoyance in his manner. He simply dismissed the
suitor with quiet civility. When Lindsay, stung to protest,
raised the question of finances, the other heard
him out patiently.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;In different conditions I might have been inclined
to consider your claim,&rdquo; he said, when Lindsay had
made an end. &ldquo;Allow me to congratulate you on your
position, which renders you a suitable <i>parti</i> for almost
any alliance&mdash;except with my daughter. No, believe
me, my decision is final,&rdquo; for he could not
know how ironical was his compliment, and took
the young man&rsquo;s uneasy gesture as heralding a
renewal of the argument. &ldquo;Miss Marten is
pledged elsewhere. She will marry Prince Montecastello.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have reason to know, sir, that the gentleman
you have mentioned is utterly distasteful to Nancy,&rdquo;
broke in the other.</p>

<p>Marten&rsquo;s face darkened; he lost some of his suave
manner. &ldquo;Have you been carrying on a clandestine
courtship with my daughter?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. A man bearing my name has no reason to
shun daylight. That I have not sought your sanction
earlier is due to the fact that I did not dream of marrying
Nancy until a stroke of good fortune enabled
me to come to you almost on an equal footing. Perhaps
I have put that awkwardly, but my very anxiety
clogs my tongue. Nancy and I love each other. She
hates this Italian. Surely that is a good reason why
you, her father, should not rule me out of court so
positively.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Marten rose and touched an electric bell. It jarred
in some neighboring passage, and rang the knell of
Lindsay&rsquo;s hopes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think we understand each other,&rdquo; he said, with
chilling indifference. &ldquo;My answer is no, Mr. Lind<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span>say,
and I look to you, as a man of honor, not to see
or write to my daughter again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now, it is not in the Celtic nature to brook such
an undeservedly contemptuous dismissal; but Power
had counseled his prot&eacute;g&eacute; to keep his temper, whatever
happened. Still, he could not leave Marten in the
belief that his stipulation was accepted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I give no pledge of that sort,&rdquo; he said dourly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well. It means simply that Miss Marten will
be protected from you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In what way?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Marten laughed, a trifle scornfully. &ldquo;You are
young, Mr. Lindsay,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;or you would see that
you are speaking at random. I hear a footman coming.
He will show you out. But, before you go, let me
inform you that, so long as you remain in this part
of Devonshire, Miss Marten will have less liberty of
action than usual; and that will be vexing, because she
is interested in some bazaar&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Lindsay&rsquo;s frank gaze sought and held the
coldly hostile eyes of the man who was insulting him.
&ldquo;In that event,&rdquo; he broke in, &ldquo;you leave me no option
but to state that I return to Aldershot by the first
available train. It would appear, Mr. Marten, that
I value your daughter&rsquo;s happiness rather more than
you do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He went out defeated, but every inch a cavalier. No
sword clanked at his heels; yet he held his head high,
though his soul was torn with despair. He saw nothing
of Nancy. She had gone for a ride into the
wilds of Exmoor, and had not the least notion that
her lover passed through the gates of Valescure an
hour before she entered them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span></p>

<p>Power heard Lindsay&rsquo;s broken story in silence.
Even Marten&rsquo;s callous threat of confining Nancy to
the bounds of the castle left him outwardly unmoved.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not altogether unprepared for your failure,&rdquo;
he said gently, when the disconsolate Lindsay had told
him exactly what had occurred. &ldquo;I compliment you
on your attitude. As might be expected, you said and
did just the right things. I approve of your decision
to rejoin your regiment at once. The next step is
to prevent Nancy from acting precipitately. I think
all may be well, even yet. But you agree that it was
necessary you should see Mr. Marten and declare your
position?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It certainly seems to have settled matters once
and for all,&rdquo; came the depressed answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By no means. It has opened the campaign. It is
a declaration of war. I need hardly advise you not
to have a faint heart where such a fair lady is the
prize. No, no, Nancy is not yet the Princess Montecastello,
nor will she ever be. <i>You</i> may not marry
her, Mr. Lindsay; but <i>he</i> will not. I shall clear
that obstacle from your path, at all events, and,
it may be, assist you materially. My offer still
holds good&mdash;remember that. For the rest, be content
to leave the whole affair to me during the
next three weeks. Don&rsquo;t write to Nancy. It will
do no good. I&rsquo;ll tell her you were here, why
you came, and why you went. Do you trust
me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Pon my soul, I do!&rdquo; said Lindsay, and their hands
met in a reassuring grip.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span></p>

<p>A servant entered, bringing a cablegram. It read:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="" width="100%">
<tr><td align='left'>&ldquo;Cable received. Everything in order.</td><td align='right'><span class="smcap">Mac.</span>&rdquo;</td></tr>
</table>
</div>

<p>Then Power smiled wearily; for the real struggle
was postponed until that sealed envelop reached him.
There followed some disturbing days. He told Nancy
of her lover&rsquo;s visit, and its outcome, and had to allay
her fears as best he could. Then, on the day of
the bazaar, when he hoped to have many hours
of her company, he discovered, in the nick of
time, that Marten and the whole house-party from
the castle had accompanied her; so he remained
away.</p>

<p>Next morning he received a letter:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;Dear Mr. Power.&mdash;My father, by some means, has
heard that you and I have become friends. He has forbidden
me ever to meet you again, or to write. I am disobeying
him this once, because I cannot bring myself to cut adrift
from a friendship dear to me without one word of explanation.
All at once my bright world is becoming gray and
threatening. I am miserable, and full of foreboding. But
I remain, and shall ever be,</p>

<p class="ralign">
<span style="margin-right: 4em;">&ldquo;Your sincere friend and well-wisher,</span><br />
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Nancy Marten</span>.&rdquo;<br />
</p></div>

<p>That same day Howard returned from the Continent.
He brought a full budget. But, in a time when
the world was even grayer for Power than for Nancy,
one person contrived to give him a very real and
pleasurable surprise. On the twelfth day after he
had received MacGonigal&rsquo;s cablegram a man in the
uniform of a London commissionaire brought him a
big linen envelop, profusely sealed. He chanced to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span>
be out when the messenger came; so the man awaited
him in the hall. He rose and saluted Power when a
house-servant indicated him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The gentleman who sent this package from London
was very particular, sir, that it should be given
into your own hands,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;He also instructed
me to ask for a receipt written by yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed. What is the gentleman&rsquo;s name?&rdquo; inquired
Power, scrutinizing the envelop to see if the address
would enlighten him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Name of MacGonigal, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, MacGonigal. A stout gentleman, sir,
an American, and very dry. He made me laugh like
anything. Talked about holdups, and road agents,
and landslides on the railway, he did. Oh, very dry!&rdquo;</p>

<p>MacGonigal himself cleared up the mystery:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;Dear Derry [he wrote].&mdash;I wasn&rsquo;t taking any chances;
so I&rsquo;ve brought that little parcel myself. Time I saw London,
anyhow, and here I am. A man in our consulate tells
me these boys with medals and crossbars are O. K., and
one of them is making the next train. I didn&rsquo;t come myself,
because I don&rsquo;t know how you are fixed; but I&rsquo;ll stand
around till I hear from you. London is some size. I think
I&rsquo;ll like it when I learn the language.</p>

<p class="ralign">
<span style="margin-right: 2em;">&ldquo;Yours,</span><br />
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Mac</span>.&rdquo;<br />
</p></div>

<p>Power&rsquo;s first impulse, warmly supported by Dacre,
was to telegraph and bid the wanderer come straight
to Devonshire, But he decided unwillingly to wait un<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span>til
he had won or lost the coming battle. He telegraphed,
of course, and told MacGonigal to enjoy
life till they met, which would be in the course of three
days, at the uttermost. Then he retired, and spent
many hours in writing, refusing Howard&rsquo;s help, and
taking a meal in his own room. It was long after midnight
when his task was ended; but he appeared at
the breakfast-table in the best of health and spirits.</p>

<p>Dacre, aware of something unusual and disturbing
in his friend&rsquo;s attitude of late, was glad to see this
pleasant change, and talked of a long-deferred drive
into the heart of Dartmoor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tomorrow,&rdquo; agreed Power cheerfully. &ldquo;I am
calling at Valescure Castle this morning, and the best
hours of the day will be lost before I am at liberty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dacre had the invaluable faculty of passing lightly
over the gravest concerns of life. He had noticed the
abrupt termination of Power&rsquo;s friendship with Nancy,
and guessed its cause; but he made no effort now to
dissuade the other from a visit which was so pregnant
of evil.</p>

<p>When the meal was ended Power summoned his
secretary to a short conclave. Then he entered a carriage,
and was driven to the castle by the roundabout
road. He could have walked there in less time; but
his reason for appearing in state became evident when
he alighted at the main entrance, and a footman hurried
to the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Marten in?&rdquo; he inquired.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is he in the library?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kindly take me to him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What name, sir?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Power gave his name, and followed close on the
man&rsquo;s heels, and the servant did not dare bid such
a distinguished-looking visitor wait in the hall. Still,
he hastened on in front, knocked at a door, and
said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. John Darien Power to see you, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell Mr. Power&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; came a stern voice; but too
late to be effective, for Power was in the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can tell me yourself, Mr. Marten,&rdquo; he said
quietly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry to thrust myself in on you in
this way; but it was necessary, as my business is important
and will brook no delay.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Marten had risen from a table littered with papers.
A cold light gleamed in his eyes; but he had the sense
and courage to refrain from creating a scene before
the discomfited footman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You may go,&rdquo; he said to the man, and the door
closed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Mr. Power,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;we are alone,
and, whatever your business, I must inform you that
your presence here is an unwelcome intrusion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;May I ask why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I mean to make that quite clear. In the first
place, I have learned, to my astonishment, that you
have wormed your way into my daughter&rsquo;s confidence,
and thereby brought about the only approach to a
quarrel that has marred our relations. Secondly&mdash;but
the one reason should suffice. I do not desire to
have any communication with you or hear anything
you have to say, or explain. Is that definite enough?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Power turned suddenly, locked the door, and put the
key in his pocket.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How dare you?&rdquo; Marten almost shouted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had to answer, and I chose the most effective
method,&rdquo; was the calm reply. &ldquo;Your long experience
of life should have taught you that there are times
and seasons when closing the ears is ineffectual. The
wise man listens, even to his worst enemy. Then he
weighs. Ultimately, he decides. That is what you are
going to do now. Won&rsquo;t you be seated? And may
I sit down? Promise me we shall not be interrupted
till I have finished, and I&rsquo;ll unlock the door.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Marten had not spoken to Power, nor, to his knowledge,
seen him, for twenty-three years. The young
and enthusiastic engineer he had sent to the Sacramento
placer mine had developed into a man whose
appearance and words would sway any gathering, no
matter how eminent or noteworthy its component
members. For some reason, utterly hidden from the
financier&rsquo;s ken,&mdash;for he was not one likely to recognize
the magnetic aura which seemed to emanate from
Power in his contact with men generally,&mdash;he was momentarily
cowed. He sank back into the chair he had
just quitted, but said, truculently enough:</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would certainly be less melodramatic if my servants
could enter the room should I be summoned in
haste.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Power unlocked the door, and drew up a chair facing
his unwilling host.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am here,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;to urge on you the vital
necessity of dismissing the Principe del Montecastello
from your house, and of permitting the announcement<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span>
of Nancy&rsquo;s forthcoming marriage with the Honorable
Philip Lindsay, son of the Earl of Colonsay&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guessed as much,&rdquo; broke in Marten wrathfully.
&ldquo;Colonsay is as poor as a church mouse. It was <i>your</i>
money which that young prig paraded before my astonished
eyes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought it advisable to state the motive of my
visit frankly,&rdquo; said Power. &ldquo;I take it you are not
inclined to discuss the matter in an amicable way;
though I am at a loss to understand why&mdash;before I
have reached any of the points I want you to consider&mdash;you
are so markedly hostile both to me and
to my purpose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll tell you,&rdquo; and Marten took a letter
from a portfolio on the table. &ldquo;It appears that my
late father-in-law, Francis Willard, had taken your
measure more accurately than I. I remember treating
you as a trustworthy subordinate; but your conduct
during my temporary absence from America at
a certain period led him to regard you as unprincipled
and knavish. He has been dead several years;
but he still lives to watch you. He left funds with
a firm of lawyers in New York to carry out his instructions,
which were that, if ever you were found
hanging about any place where I or any member of
my family was residing, I should be warned against
you, because, owing to his action, and that alone, my
dear wife was saved from something worse than a mere
indiscretion in which you were the prime factor. A
dead hand can reach far sometimes. On this occasion
it has stretched across the Atlantic. The communication
I received a few days ago is quite explicit.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span>
These lawyers have, at times, been much troubled to
discover your whereabouts; but, on this occasion, their
English agents have kept their eyes open.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Can vengeance be pursued farther than death?&rsquo;&rdquo;
murmured Power, shocked by this revelation of Willard&rsquo;s
undying hatred.</p>

<p>The other did not recognize the quotation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and what is more,&rdquo; he snarled, &ldquo;they go
on to say that Willard has intrusted a document to
their care which will scare you effectually if this present
remonstrance is unavailing. In that event, they
will act on their own initiative, and not through me.
I wonder what the precious scandal is?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am here to make it known, known beyond reach
of doubt or dispute.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Marten moved uneasily. He tossed the letter back
into the portfolio, and glared at Power in silence for
a few seconds.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I neither care to hear your secrets nor mean to
attach any significance to them when heard,&rdquo; he said,
at last. &ldquo;My only anxiety is to prevent you from
sapping my daughter&rsquo;s affections from me. Damn you,
you have caused the one cloud that has come between
us!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I, too, have Nancy&rsquo;s welfare at heart.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see what good purpose you serve by alluding
to my daughter in that impertinently familiar
way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now we are close to the heart of the mystery.
Nancy is not your daughter! She is my daughter!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Marten leaned back in his chair, and glowered at
the self-possessed man who had uttered these extraor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span>dinary
words so calmly. His voice was tinged with
sadness, it is true, but otherwise wholly devoid of
emotion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you realize what you are saying?&rdquo; demanded
the older man, and the words came thickly, as though
he spoke with difficulty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But such raving is not argument. I thought you
remarked that you were here to convince me of the
error of my ways.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Power produced an envelop, and extracted some
papers. &ldquo;Read!&rdquo; he said, leaning forward and thrusting
the folded sheets before Marten. &ldquo;The letters
quoted there are not in original, of course. I have left
those in safe-keeping, and they will be burnt on the day I
know for certain that my daughter is married to the
man she loves. Read! Note the dates! I need not
say another word. I have supplied such brief explanatory
passages as are required. I was not aware
that Mowlem &amp; Son had tendered other evidence.
Though slight, it is helpful.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Marten read, and his face, dark and lowering
as he began, soon faded to the tint of old ivory. For
his hawk&rsquo;s eyes were perusing the story of his own
and Willard&rsquo;s perfidy, and of his wife&rsquo;s revolt, and
love, and final surrender. It was soon told. Nancy&rsquo;s
pitiful scrawl, left in the hut by the lake, Willard&rsquo;s
letter to Mrs. Power, the two cablegrams, and Nancy&rsquo;s
two letters from London&mdash;these, with Power&rsquo;s notes,
giving chapter and verse for his arrival at Newport,
his flight with Nancy into the Adirondacks, and her
departure with Willard, made up a document hard<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span>
to disbelieve, almost impossible to gainsay. Some dry
and faded strands of white heather had fallen from
among the papers to the table, and Marten gave no
heed to them at first. Now he knew he was gazing at
the remnants of Nancy&rsquo;s bridal bouquet.</p>

<p>The husband whom she loathed and had deserted,
who was so detestable in her sight that she died rather
than remain his wife, did not attempt to deny the truth
of that overwhelming indictment. Indeed, its opening
passages, laying bare his own scheming, must have convinced
him of the accuracy of the remainder. With
the painstaking care of one to whom the written word
was all-important, he read and reread each letter, particularly
Nancy&rsquo;s pathetic farewell. Then, darting one
wolfish glance at Power, he thrust his right hand suddenly
toward a drawer. Power was prepared for some
such movement, and leaped with a lightning spring born
of many a critical adventure in wild lands, when a
fraction of a second of delay meant all the difference
between life and death. Marten was not a weakling;
but he was no match for the younger man&rsquo;s well-trained
muscles. After a brief struggle the automatic
pistol he had taken from its hiding-place was wrested
from his grasp.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You may shoot, if you like, when I have finished
with you, but not before,&rdquo; said Power, when his breathless
adversary seemed to be in a fit condition to follow
what he was saying. &ldquo;I am prepared to die, and
by your hand if you think fit to be my executioner; but
first you must know the penalty. If I do not return
to my friend&rsquo;s house before a fixed hour, an exact copy
of all that you have read will be sent to the father<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span>
and uncle of that detestable blackguard you have chosen
to marry my daughter. It seems that Italians are
blessed with fine-drawn scruples in such matters, and
the revelation of a blot in Nancy&rsquo;s parentage will be
fatal to your precious project. Copies will also be
given to Nancy herself, and to Philip Lindsay. If
I know anything of men, I fancy that he, at any rate,
will not flout her because of her mother&rsquo;s sin. In the
event of my death, she becomes my heiress; so she will
be quite independent of your bounty, and, after the
first shock and horror of comprehension has passed,
I think she has enough of her mother&rsquo;s spirit, and of
my fairly strong will, to defy any legal rights you may
try to enforce as her reputed father. I am talking
with brutal plainness, Marten, because you&rsquo;ve got to
understand that you are beaten to your knees. Now
I&rsquo;ll repeat my terms. Dismiss an unspeakable cad from
your house&mdash;not forcibly, of course, but with sufficient
conviction that he cannot refuse to go&mdash;agree to
Nancy&rsquo;s marriage with the man of her choice&mdash;and she
should wait another year, at least, whether or not Lindsay
be the man&mdash;and I burn everything, copies and
originals, on her wedding day. Refuse, and you know
the sure outcome. There is your pistol. It should do
its work well at this short range. Shoot, if you must!
I am ready!&rdquo;</p>

<h2><small>CHAPTER XX</small><br />

THE PASSING OF THE STORM</h2>


<p>Marten&rsquo;s hand closed round the butt of the pistol,
and, during a few seconds, Power thought that he was
a doomed man. Even in England, a land where deeds
of violence are not condoned by lawless unwritten law,
he knew he was in deadly peril. If Marten shot him,
there was reasonable probability that punishment
might not follow the crime. His own actions would
bear out the contention that Marten had killed him
in self-defense. He had palpably forced his way in;
the warning letter from the New York lawyers would
count against him; legal ingenuity could twist in Marten&rsquo;s
favor the very means he was using to safeguard
Nancy&rsquo;s child. But he did not fear death. Rather
did he look on it as the supreme atonement. &ldquo;Greater
love hath no man than this, that he lay down his life for
his friend,&rdquo; and, in giving his life for an innocent girl,
he was surely obeying her mother&rsquo;s last request.</p>

<p>But Marten, still clutching the pistol&mdash;a modern
weapon of fearsome effect when fired in conditions
which made faulty aim impossible&mdash;seemed to be marshaling
his disrupted thoughts. His eyes were veiled,
his body was bent as though old age had suddenly beset
him; but the ivory-white of cheeks and forehead
was yielding slowly to the quickening of the arteries
caused by the recent struggle.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span></p>

<p>At last he looked at Power, and may have been
surprised by the discovery that his adversary, though
standing within a yard of him, obviously disregarded
his presence, and was, in fact, staring through
a window at the far horizon of the blue Atlantic.</p>

<p>For the first time he was aware of an expression
in Power&rsquo;s face that was baffling, almost unnerving.
Suffering, pity, sympathy, well-doing&mdash;these essentials
had never found lodgment in his own nature, and their
legible imprint on another&rsquo;s features was foreign to
his eyes. He was wholly self-centered, self-contained.
To his material mind men and women were mere elements
in the alchemy of gold-making; yet here stood
one who had never sought the gross treasures which
earth seemed to delight in showering on him. And
he could win what Marten had never won&mdash;love. That
thought rankled. Already Nancy was yielding to his
influence. Unless&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>He replaced the pistol in the drawer where it was
kept, ever within reach&mdash;he had ruined opponents by
the score, and some were vengeful. The movement
awoke Power from a species of trance, and their eyes
met.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You win,&rdquo; said Marten laconically.</p>

<p>Power sat down again. The simplicity of his self-effacement
almost bewildered the other, on whom the
knowledge was forced that, had he raised and pointed
the death-dealing weapon, his enemy would have disregarded
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want to ask you a few questions,&rdquo; he continued
bruskly. &ldquo;I suppose you and I can afford now to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span>
tell each other the naked truth. Why are you raising
all this commotion after twenty years?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am only fulfilling the mandate given in&mdash;in your
wife&rsquo;s last letter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My wife. You admit, then, that she <i>was</i> my wife?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Power did not answer, and Marten tingled with the
quick suspicion that he was opening up the very line
of inquiry in which he was most vulnerable.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Anyhow, let us endeavor to forget what happened
twenty years ago,&rdquo; he went on, affecting a generosity
of sentiment he was far from feeling. &ldquo;What I wish
to understand is this&mdash;how do you reconcile your regret,
or repentance, or whatever you choose to call
it, for bygone deeds, with your attempt now to come
between me and my daughter. Yes, damn you, whatever
you may say or do, you cannot rob me of the
nineteen years of affection which at least one person
in the world has given me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Power passed unheeded that sudden flame of passionate
resentment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is natural, in a sense, that you should misread
the actual course of events,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You may not
be aware that I have been a constant visitor to this
part of Devonshire during many years, and that, in
hiring Valescure, you were really seeking me instead
of me, as you imagine, seeking you. I met Nancy by
accident. We became friends. It was the impulse of
a girl deprived of the one adviser in whom she should
have complete trust that led her to confide in me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean by that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You, her loved and honored father, were using your
authority to force her into a hated marriage.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t treat matters so seriously. I never heard
of this young Lindsay as a candidate before last
week.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Had you taken a tenth part of the trouble it has
cost me, you would have ascertained that the Principe
del Montecastello was about as suitable a mate for
Nancy as a carrion crow for a linnet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was a bit wild in his youth, but would become
a model husband. I know that type of man well. At
fifty he would be taking the chair at rescue meetings.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Again Power remained silent, and Marten was
obliged to reopen the discussion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get rid of Montecastello,&rdquo; he said, and his
voice had the metallic rasp of a file in it. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll undertake,
too, that my daughter shall be free to marry
Philip Lindsay, or any other man of her choice. I
suppose it will be Lindsay. I&rsquo;ll invite him here, and
make up for my rather emphatic dismissal the other
day. But if you impose terms, so do I. To avoid a
scandal, to keep my daughter&rsquo;s love during the remaining
years of my life, I yield to you on the major point.
On my side, I stipulate that not one penny of your
money goes to either Lindsay or Nancy. They must
owe everything to me, not to you. Further, you must
undertake to go out of my daughter&rsquo;s life completely.
You have contrived to do that in the past; you must
manage it in the future as well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean that I am never voluntarily to see or
speak to her again?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I promise that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Power spoke in a low tone, but a note of unutterable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span>
sadness crept into the words. Even his bitter and
resentful hearer caught some hint of anguish, of final
abandonment, of a dream that was dispelled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, about these papers,&rdquo; he said, striving to assume
a business-like air. &ldquo;I shall write to Mowlem
&amp; Son telling them that the Willard trust has attained
its object. Sometime I shall endeavor personally to
get them to hand over any document in their possession.
They are only agents. They can be bought. As to
these,&rdquo; and he tapped the sheets in Power&rsquo;s handwriting,
&ldquo;I shall keep them until you have carried
out your share of the deal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Better not. You may die suddenly. Then they
would be found.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Die, may I? And what about you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall not die until the future of Nancy&rsquo;s child
is assured. In any event, I have taken steps to safeguard
her secret.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Marten hesitated. Ultimately he applied a lighted
match to the papers, threw them into a grate, and
watched them burn and curl up in black spirals. When
they were still ablaze he gathered the bits of crackling
heather, and burnt them, too.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That, then, is the end,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The beginning of the end,&rdquo; said Power, turning
to leave the room. It was a very large apartment,
and there were windows at each end. Through those
on the landward side he saw Nancy riding toward the
gates in company with a young married couple who
had joined the house party recently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;With your permission, I will wait a few minutes,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;Your daughter is just crossing the park;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span>
but she will soon be out of sight. I&rsquo;ll dismiss my carriage,
and walk home by the cliff path.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your&rdquo; daughter. So he really meant to keep his
word in letter and spirit! Marten thought him a
strange man, a visionary. He had never met such another&mdash;undoubtedly,
he was half mad!</p>

<p>In a little while Power walked out. Then Marten
noticed, for the first time, that he moved with a slight
limp; the result of some accident, no doubt. Curse
him, why wasn&rsquo;t he killed? Then Nancy Marten would
have become a princess, with no small likelihood of
occupying a throne. For that was Marten&rsquo;s carefully
planned scheme. A certain principality was practically
in the market. It could be had for money.
Money would do anything&mdash;almost anything. Today
money had failed!</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Power planned to take MacGonigal by surprise.
He wrote with purposed vagueness as to his arrival
in London, meaning to drop in on his stout friend
unexpectedly. He arrived about six o&rsquo;clock in the evening
at the big hotel where Mac was installed, and
was informed that &ldquo;Mr. MacGonigal&rdquo; was out, but
might return at any moment. He secured a suite of
rooms, and was crossing the entrance hall, with no
other intent than to sit there and await Mac&rsquo;s appearance,
when he almost cannoned against a woman&mdash;a
woman with lustrous, penetrating brown eyes. What
was worse, he stood stock still, and stared at her in a
way that might well evoke her indignation.</p>

<p>But, if she was annoyed, she masked her feelings
under an amused smile.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t recall me, of course, Mr. Power,&rdquo; she
said; &ldquo;but I remember you quite well&mdash;even after
twenty years!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Meg!&rdquo; he cried.</p>

<p>She reddened somewhat. Though wearing a hat and
an out-of-doors costume, she was unveiled, and there
was no trace of scar or disfigurement on her face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Marguerite Sinclair, at any rate,&rdquo; she answered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sent here by the gods!&rdquo; he muttered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your gods are false gods, Mr. Power. I, for one,
don&rsquo;t recognize them as guides.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Marguerite Sinclair!&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;So you are
unmarried?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you?&rdquo; she retorted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I? I am free, at last.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Free?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. Come with me. We can find a seat somewhere.
If you have any engagement, you must break
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She dropped her veil hurriedly. If there are tears
in a woman&rsquo;s eyes, she does not care to have the fact
noticed while she is crossing the crowded foyer of a
hotel. Manlike, Power attributed her action to the
wrong cause.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why hide your face?&rdquo; he said, striving hard to
control an unaccountable tremolo in his voice. &ldquo;What
have you been doing? Praying at Lourdes?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She did not pretend to misunderstand: &ldquo;A French
doctor worked this particular miracle. The chief ingredients
were some months of suffering and the skin of
eggs. It was not vanity on my part. I was tired of the
world&rsquo;s pity.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then, thank Heaven, I loved you before your scientist
doubled your good looks!&rdquo;</p>

<p>They had found two chairs in a palm-shaded corner,
and Marguerite raised her veil again. Then he
saw why she had lowered it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Derry,&rdquo; she said, and her lips quivered, &ldquo;why
were you so cruel?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you. May I?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not now. I couldn&rsquo;t bear it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can you bear being told that I have never ceased
to love you&mdash;that you have dwelt constantly in my
thoughts during all these slow years?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She bent her head. For a long time neither spoke.
Plucking at a glove, she revealed a ring on her left
hand&mdash;his ring! Then Power began his confession.
He did not tell her everything&mdash;that was impossible.
Nor was it necessary. In the first moment of their
meeting he had said what she had been waiting thirteen
long years to hear.</p>

<p>So, as the outcome, it was MacGonigal who surprised
Power. A clerk at the key office gave him the
name of the gentleman who had been inquiring for
him, and, although taken aback by finding Power deep
in talk with a lady, Mac &ldquo;butted in&rdquo; joyously.</p>

<p>The two stood up, and Power took his friend&rsquo;s hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mac,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;this is Miss Marguerite Sinclair.
You&rsquo;ll soon be well acquainted with her. She becomes
Marguerite Power at the earliest possible date.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now, MacGonigal had formed his own conclusions,
owing to the urgency of the message for that sealed
packet. Anxiety, and not a desire to see life, had
drawn him from his shell in Bison. Power&rsquo;s words<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span>
had answered many unspoken questions, solved all
manner of doubts. His face shone, his big eyes bulged
alarmingly. He mopped a shining forehead with, alas!
a red handkerchief.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wall, ef I ain&rsquo;t dog-goned!&rdquo; he vowed. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m
glad, mighty glad. You&rsquo;ve worried me, Derry, an&rsquo;
that&rsquo;s a fact.&rdquo; He turned to Marguerite, little guessing
how well she knew him. &ldquo;Bring him to the ranch,
Ma&rsquo;am, an&rsquo; keep him thar!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll look like
home when you come along. An&rsquo; that&rsquo;s what he wants&mdash;a
home. I don&rsquo;t know whar he met you, nor when,
but I kin tell you this&mdash;he&rsquo;s been like a lost dog fer
thirteen years, an&rsquo; it&rsquo;s time he was fixed with a collar
an&rsquo; chain. Anyhow, when he&rsquo;s had a good look at you,
he&rsquo;ll not need the chain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mac,&rdquo; said the woman with the shining eyes,
&ldquo;you&rsquo;re a dear!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And from that moment the firm of Power and MacGonigal
acquired another partner.</p>


<p class="center"><br /><br /><small>THE END</small></p>
